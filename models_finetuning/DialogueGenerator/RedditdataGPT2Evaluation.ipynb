I'm working on a more complex solution for iOS, but I can't get my hands around them. That's probably why I'm not putting Excel on my iPad.There are four options here - you can use the spreadsheet, you can use the spreadsheet without the spreadsheet, or you can use Excel for both and find all your functions in easy to find places. On Macs you can get it for just under $40. Windows is not exactly my thing, but even if it's pretty good they still have a lot more stuff that doesn't seem to be as awesome as in Windows 95.
