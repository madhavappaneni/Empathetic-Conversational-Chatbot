Evalation results are executed and available in the notebook files provided.

As the reddit dataset is large. Its not uploaded to github. I compressed this dataset and saved in google drive link. Dataset needs to be downloaded from this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODMJmQzGKN5Y0AbSJrMgWBoolztgEx3_/view?usp=sharing before executing this jupyter notebook.

For executing the evaluation code without dataset, exiisting file ref_gen_master.pkl in same directory can be used to reproduce the results. In ref_gen_master.pkl, I have stored the list of generated_sentences generated by model and reference_sentences from test_dataset.



For re-evaluating and reproducing the results reported, run the cells sequentially in the notebooks present in the directory. Install the required dependencies listed.
The necessary data files are provided in the same directory and will be loaded when the cells are executed.
The authentication token to download models hosted on Huggingface is also provided in the scripts.

metrics for the experimental sentence completion module can be found in ../../milestone3/

In case any errors are encountered during Evalation, the notebooks in the milestone2 and milestone3 directories contain evaluation metrics on the evaluation splits of the dataset. These results. 
will be close to the reported results.


For evaluating bleurt score these steps should be followed.
1. wget https://storage.googleapis.com/bleurt-oss-21/BLEURT-20.zip .
