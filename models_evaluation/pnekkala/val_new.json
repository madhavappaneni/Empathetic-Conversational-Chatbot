People just make you and that's it- it's your problem now. There is no consideration that what is being done is unfair. Or they will say tough luck life's unfair- how convenient that they don't have to live with the consequences. In a way, they *do* have to live with the consequences when they have to take care of the children they have, especially if the children have special needs. But to answer your question, I think it was the argument that even a \"perfect and wonderful\" world isn't good enough to procreate in when \"perfect\" and \"wonderful\" are subjective and people are different.",

I\u2019ve noticed a lot of men complaining how women are avoiding talking or discussing sex with their man because of their own insecurities or their own problems or mental issues that stop them wanting to engage in a sexually committed relationship. I also see it being why a lot of marriages end. \n\nI am all for everything being a woman\u2019s choice seeing as it\u2019s her body. Same when it comes to abortions etc. But if you are literally asking a man to marry you; yet withhold basic needs of sexual satisfaction from him you do not deserve to be in a relationship with him.\n\nIf you are not willing to go to effective counselling, talk it out or come to some kind of compromise; you are going to cause rightful anger from him and sexual frustration. It\u2019s not just you that has needs he does as well. He\u2019s not entitled sure but he should be allowed to leave if you can\u2019t fulfil him and find his needs being met elsewhere. \n\nA committed relationship takes two to tango and if you can\u2019t even provide him sex then he should either be allowed to leave, find a way to fix the problem with you or simply masturbate until you\u2019ve resolved your own problems. Are there any situations where a man is **not allowed** to masturbate or leave? I cannot think of any. Last I checked, masturbation and divorce are perfectly legal options available to the man here.\n\nOr, are you saying **allowed** in a purely conjectural sense? In which case, there's no view to be changed. It's not a position to believe that people should do what they can actually do. That's just reality.",

            "text": "A lot of the answers here are a bit misleading. There are two effects which contribute to moons and satellites drifting inward or outwards, and they aren't really connected to any kind of 'perfect orbit'.\n\nOne effect is called orbital decay. This is caused by things like atmospheric drag, various electromagnetic and radiative interactions, etc. that can happen between orbiting bodies. These take energy away from the orbital system and cause the bodies to fall in closer together, picking up more orbital speed as they do so. In planetary systems, these drag effects are pretty tiny so decay takes a very long time.\n\nThe other effect is called tidal acceleration. This happens when the orbiting bodies are spinning at a different speed than the orbital revolutions, and it can often work a lot faster than orbital decay effects. In the case of the Earth-moon system, the moon's rotation is tidally locked to us, but ours is not locked to it; we spin around once per day, much faster than the orbital period of 28 days. That means that the Earth's rotational energy is gradually being transmitted *to* the moon, pushing it outwards. If nothing else were to disturb the earth-moon system, this would continue until all the angular momentum has equalized between the earth and moon, and each is tidally locked to the other. And then, over millions and millions more years, orbital decay would start to bring the earth and moon back towards each other until they collide. &gt; each is tidally locked to the other. And then, over millions and millions more years, orbital decay would start to bring the earth and moon back towards each other until they collide.\n\nBillions of years. But it's the *solar* tide that would then continue to slow the Earth's rotation, bringing the Moon back down. \n\n(If the Sun's red-giant phase didn't, you know, cause other effects.)",

In the Bronze Age, transporting elephants across long distances, let alone at the regularity required to create breeding populations, would have been unfeasible. So the amount of fossils, and the fact that remains of juvenile elephants have also been found supports the argument that they were not just a population of feral war elephants.\n\nAlso the fact that E. maximus is rarely preserved in fossil form in general, and the lack of evidence for predation indicate that there is a strong possibility that the elephants are not introduced by humans.\n\nI would also like to add that instead of being artificially introduced, Pleistocene survivors may have gradually expanded their range throughout the Middle East during the Early Bronze Age moist climatic period.

            "text": "I've been a Park Ranger for a little under 6 months, and I almost quit in my first week. You see, I've always preferred being in nature as opposed to the city, mostly because I enjoy the quiet, and when I was a kid, watching Crocodile Hunter and other nature conservation shows and stories, I love animals. The things I've seen and had to deal with, though... I'm not sure they classify as even real...\n\nThe first night I showed up to work, I arrived 10 minutes early, and little did I know at the time, it was the worst mistake I made on my first day. It's a small park, and it didn't need more than two rangers on-site at a time, but most of the time we just had one. I was greeted by the Ranger from the shift before on arrival and given the rundown of what I'd be doing that night, mostly just hanging out in the information building and monitoring trail and site cameras. Once every couple of hours in the 10-hour shift, I would patrol one of the 4 quadrants the park was divided into.\n\nWhat no one told me my first day, is that the night shift Park Ranger either goes missing or dies within the first week. I found this out later that night, and not from the first shift Ranger.\n\nAfter the first 2 hours of monitoring cameras and helping the 2 people that stopped by the information center, I set out on patrol, choosing the quadrant I went to at random. In the end, I decided on the East quadrant, one of the more undisturbed areas of the park. I hopped in the sorry excuse for a patrol car, more like a buggy or ATV than a car, and headed towards the East quadrant.\n\nIt was a quiet drive for the most part, except for the sounds of crickets and occasional owl's hoot. But as I got closer to the East quadrant, I noticed the sounds began to die away, slowly but surely, until all was silent. I preferred the quiet anyway, so the sounds dying away was less alarming than it was calming for me. I had a smile on my face as I began making my round.\n\nI expected not to find many, if any, campers in this section of the park. But about halfway through my patrol, I came across a bald man stumbling down the trail. I stopped the car a little ways away from him, weak headlights shining directly at him. I pulled out my flashlight and hopped out of the car, approaching the hobbling man. \"Excuse me, sir? Are you alright? You don't look that well.\" He had stopped dead in his tracks when I noticed him, but I hardly took notice of it as I approached. The only thing that struck me as strange was the fact that the man had his head tilted down, so a shadow cast across his face.\n\nHe spoke with a speech impediment, he spokes slowly and deeply, and it sounded like his mouth was stuffed with bread. \"Ran.. ger,\" he hadn't moved a muscle, and I never saw his mouth open as he spoke, it struck me as odd and I stopped with a little bit of distance between us. The injured-looking man hadn't moved at all since I spotted him. \"You musht.. be the new.. ranger.\" I noticed a slight amount of movement in the shadows splayed across his face, and a small amount of noise, like something being sharpened or sliced. I found it odd that this man was able to identify me as the 'new ranger', but maybe he was just a regular to the park. \"I am, do you need help?\"  \n\"It'sh been.. sho long.. shince I've had.. a meal, Ran.. ger.. help.. me.\"\n\nI had brought along a few protein bars with me, wanting a snack for the shift, and I had brought some along as I didn't know how long the patrol would take. \"Come with me, back over to my patrol car. Have you been lost out here, sir? Do you need any assistance other than food?\" The strange man made no move to come closer, he just stood where I had first found him, stone still. \"I am.. only hungry.. Ranger.\" I stared at him for a few more moments, before turning to walk back to my patrol car. \"Then come with me, I'll give you some protein bars, and after that, I think you should come with me..\"\n\nI trailed off because at that moment I felt and heard something behind me, breathing down my neck and breathing heavily. From behind, I heard, \"Last mistake.. you'll ever make... Ranger. Now.. I can.. EAT.\" I heard the snapping of bones from behind me as the strange man slammed into my back, winding me and knocking me to the ground. I tried to catch my breath and scramble up and towards my patrol car, but with surprising speed after such a forceful blow, the man put all of his weight onto my back. I heard a guttural sound coming from the man behind me and felt a slimy smattering of something wet drip onto and soak through my uniform.\n\nI had begun to recover from the blow to my back and noticed I still clutched the flashlight in my hand. I took in a sharp quick breath, bracing myself as I twisted and swung wildly, connecting with the butt of the flashlight to something, as his foot slid off my back. I took a look up at the man and noticed the most horrifying image I'd ever seen up to that point. His mouth hung open in the most inhuman way, and rows of long needle- and saw-like teeth, the number of which was impossibly large. Drool dripped from his mouth and the sickly-sweet smell of rotting flesh and death assaulted my nostrils.\n\nThe man was posed like a tiger ready to pounce as I stared at him, but the longer I stared in horror at this monstrosity, the more I noticed he wouldn't move a muscle. The creature in front of me snarled as I began backing up slowly, scooting my way across the ground towards the patrol car. \"You got.. lucky this time... Ran..ger. I'll get you.. next time.. you come to.. this place. Just like.. the last.\" He made a noise, an unearthly noise like stones grinding together mixed with the call of a wild animal. Something about his face gave me the impression he was amused... like he was laughing.\n\nI got to my feet and kept eye contact as I opened the door to my patrol car and climbed inside, trembling and struggling to get the key into the ignition as I stared at the creature. I noticed he still didn't move if I blinked, so luckily I didn't have to strain my eyes, but multitasking and spatial awareness were already not my strong suit. I struggled for another 5 minutes before starting the patrol vehicle back up and I slammed my foot on the gas pedal, swerving around the man and trying to make my way around the circuit to get back to the information center. The haunting laughter of the creature followed me as it echoed throughout the forest. I feel like he let me go on purpose.. it's like he got bored of easy kills, and now he wants to hunt me.\n\nI hastily completed the circuit and made it back to the information center. This.. thing had told me he had killed other Rangers in the past, but there's no mention at all of anything like him in the park. So as soon as I made it back to the information center, I began to write out a list, a reminder for myself and the next Ranger after I quit this place because at the time I convinced myself I was going to be able to quit. I took a sheet of printer paper from the machine and began writing: \"Rules to Survive the Night Shift.  \nRule 1: Never break line of sight with the bald man with the strange lisp. If you do, pray he lets you go.\" Oooh I love all of these people popping up on this sub lately with lists of eccentric rules that are necessary for the survival of their workplace/stomping grounds. It sounds like you are in the same timeline as Goat Valley Campgrounds and the recent poster about an old bookstore...",

Anyway, I\u2019ve met someone that I really love. My mama has allowed me and my boyfriend to live in a trailer that we were using for storage behind her house. We just have to pay utilities etc. that way I can pay down on student debt etc. Anyway, there has been drama basically since we started dating/living together. She says that I\u2019m putting him first. That I don\u2019t ever spend time with her anymore or talk to her. She says my boyfriend and his family are \u201cmountains people\u201d and weren\u2019t raised like I was. She keeps saying that I\u2019m going to leave her alone and she will have nobody. She says I might as well move away now so she can get used to being along. She said she doesn\u2019t want to be a part of our children\u2019s life if we have any. She said she is never gonna be second to anyone. Apparently I\u2019m putting her second behind my boyfriend? I know this is a rambling mess, but there is just so much.

Your mom has narcissistic behavior. She used the idea of you finding someone and staying close to keep you with her. Now that you do have someone and are moving forward with your life, she is making you feel guilty. Your partner in life should be first until you have children. Then your family is first. You pick a life partner, you don't pick a parent. \n\nIt's time to move out. She will continue to cause problems for your relationship as long as you allow her to. She has made in clear that the only thing she wants is for the ground that she walks on to be worshipped, once you don't provide that to her, she doesn't care about you. Her love is conditional and those conditions aren't being met by you because you have someone else that you care about.

            "text": "[The segment starts at 32:21](https://youtu.be/QOGJu0_8slw?t=1941)\n\n1) Education has degraded in this country.  \n\nI'm highly inclined to agree.  I went to public high school in the mid to late 2000s, and I genuinely feel like I was robbed of a quality education.  I felt like the school was failing me and MANY of the other kids who went there.  I hate to blame teachers, but some (not all) of them openly bullied their students, created miserable learning environments, were not great communicators, were not willing to make very necessary accommodations, shutdown attempts by students to communicate problems, and generally acted like they were miserable and didn't want to be teaching us. \n\n2) No child left behind was an educational nightmare\n\nThis sentiment was expressed by more than one teacher while I was in high school.  \n\n3) Every child is unique and brings unique aptitudes, weaknesses, and issues from home. \n\n100% agree.  I firmly believe that education in the US will never fully work until this is acknowledged and a system is designed that can create a unique learning plan for each chiild.  Common core/no child left behind appear to fail to want to acknowledge that the system can be fixed by implementing one size fits all solutions.  No, you need a dynamic model that can change according to the child's needs, motivations, interests, and aptitudes.  I think that the system is more geared towards creating a filtration mechanism used by higher education to select top students rather than trying to ensure that each student learns and reaches their fullest potential, but that's for a different conversation. \n\n4) Class sizes need to get lower\n\n40 kids to a class is untenable.  I honestly think that the classroom model is largely outdated.  I found that working with private tutors was VASTLY more effective than learning in a class.  I just found that the information delivery method was vastly too dilute in a lecture setting.  Regardless, one teacher can only handle so many kids. \n\n5) School doesn't teach basic life skills. \n\n100% agree.  So many kids would be so much better off, and likely more engaged, if they were taught things they could use in real life.  People need to know how to identify scams/MLMs, how to budget finances, how to invest their money, that sort of thing. \n\n6) School should find and nurture aptitude, not punish deficiency.\n\nAgain, I agree.  Punishing kids and humiliating them with bad grades in subjects that they dislike, aren't engaged in, don't have the support at home to succeed in, and aren't taught well makes the problem of bad learning outcomes even worse.  It creates a sense of futility in students.  It ruins their confidence in themselves.  It creates feelings of helplessness, and it disengages previously engaged students.  \n\nKids need additional support when they don't get something, but instead, all many of them get is a bad grade, an angry look from the teacher whom they aren't validating, anger from their parents, and often, loss of broader opportunities.  TJ even once talked about how he wasn't allowed to join the school's debate team because his GPA was too low.  The school barred him from participating in something that actively engaged him due to poor performance.  It's not hard to understand why he dropped out of school.  I think that there are good arguments for completely or partially abolishing the grading system in school.  It's supposed to hold kids accountable, but in many cases, it just creates more problems than it solves. \n\nOkay, here are a few things I'd add to what Paul is saying.\n\n1) A lot of kids' educational struggles could be rectified if you gave them a little more time.  Kids learn things at different rates, yet kids are taught using a lock-step curriculum.  Schools need to engineer self-paced learning options for the kids who/want need it.  It's utterly baffling to me that schools have not attempted to implement something so obvious.  \n\n2) Nothing beats one-on-one instruction.  Classroom learning is just too diffuse.  Too little information makes it to each and every kid.  Classrooms should be there for open discussions, not lectures.  When I was in school, whenever I worked one-on-one with a private tutor, I could always tell that I was making progress, and I always felt a sense of confidence building in myself.  I also built a much better relationshiip with the tutor because we spent so much time working together.  I felt like she was genuinely invested in my learning in a way that my school teachers were not because she got to know me so well.  She learned my learning style and was able to adapt her teachinig to my needs.  For me, I'm highly introverted, so only having to interact with one person whom I was comfortable with was an enormous blessing.  I can't say the same for the school environment where I was forced to be in a crowded, anxiety-inducing environment full of people I never wanted to be around.\n\nAt the end of the day, tutoring costs more than traditiional school per pupil, but if you factor in the societal cost of bad educational outcomes, it starts to look like a bargain.  On top of that, not every student needs, or would do better with, tutoring.  Some would do better with traditional schooling, so you'd only have to pay for the kids who most need it.  My piano teacher had 31 students, and he was still able to give each one a personalized lesson each week that was focused to their ability level, interests, and aptitudes.  The student/teacher ratio in my school district is 16:1, so I don't think that a lack of teachers is something that couldn't be overcome. \n\n3) Bad teachers exist, are a problem, and do a lot of damage.  One bad teacher can do an enormous amount of damage to a child's confidence and overall learning.  Often, bad teachers leave more of a mark on kids than good ones do.  Malcolm Gladwell once said that a teacher at the 20th percentile rank can teach a class of kids half of a year's material in one year while a teacher at the 80th percentile can teach a kid one and a half years of material in a year. \n\nSchools need to implement programs where bad teachers are identified and given support and funding as they make the transition to a new career.  Don't just fire them.  They put a lot of time into becoming a teacher, and many didn't know that they wouldn't like or enjoy the job.  Give them the same compassion you'd give the struggling kids.  Help them.  If it's unlikely that they are going to improve as teachers, give them support as they get re-certified for another career. \n\n4) Not all kids come from homes with parents who can help them with school work.  I feel like too much of the learning is expected to take place at home.  My mom wasn't able to help my brother and I with our work beyond about the 2nd grade.  It was obvious to me that we were being given assignments that were designed to be done with the aid of a parent.  We live in a country where 46 million adults are considered functionally illiterate.  Many of those adults have kids in school.  How are those kids going to get help with HW when their parent(s) can't read or write? \"Education has degraded in this country.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't watch Paul's take on this (no time right now) but this is the only thing I have an issue with in your argument.\n\nI graduated from public school in 2000. I went to an exam school, I had to pass a test in Middle School for entry so maybe I'm biased and have a skewered perspective but what is this being compared to? I remember a few years earlier the huge controversy of teaching evolution in school. My friends were being taught creationism, fucking creationism, in their science classes at their school as just as valid as evolution.",

            "text": "So for anyone who needs a quite reminder, the Bechdel test is a test to measure of the representation of women in fiction. To pass the Bechdel test the Story needs to have \n\n\u2022 at least two named female characters\n\n\u2022 they need to have a conservation between each other\n\n\u2022 the conversation must be about something else then a man\n\nThe test has been criticized widely for being a overly versimplified and excluding many stories that have good female representation. The movie Gravity for example wouldn't Pass the BT, since there are only two characters and one of them is a man, even though the female character is the Center of the Story. The Book Annihilation wouldn't also pass, despited having an all female cast, because none of the women are named. Also the thrid role seems kinda odd. A Story where two named women discuess the survial rate an injured soldier passes or fails the test depending whether the soldier is male or female. I picked this example because the soldier in this Story isn't a source of power or someone who dominates the two women nor are they are love intrest. Their gender is irrelevant to the Story.\n\nOverall the BT seems to be a rather unreliable methode to messure female representation - yet it is to be a rather good check for long storys with large ensembles.  For example if you write an Asoiaf-like epic series with 200 named characters and you never pass the Bechdel test once... then mabye there's some truth to the Idea that you representation of women is rather meh. So I wouldn't throw the BT completely out of the window, but make some adjustments, when it's useful to use it and when one of the three rules should be ignored though to special circumstances. So my solution would be the following: \n\n\u2022 The Bechdel test should only be applied to Story where there are two male characters that would Pass a genderbend Version of the BT's rules (being named, having a conversation about something else then a woman). \n\n\u2022 If the author excludes all names of his characters for artistic purposes (like in Annihilation) The test is still passed.\n\n\u2022 Similarly, if the gender of the characters is never explicitly stated (For example first or second POV; artistic purposes) the Story should not be messaured by the BT.\n\n\u2022 If the Story passes rules 1 and 2 but the conversation is about a man, the test is only then failed if the man is a) a romantic intrest of either of the women or b) The sole motivation to both women in the entire story. \n\n\u2022 the langer the character cast is, the more useful is the Bechdel test to messaure female agency. A theatre play with 3 characters can't be compared to 800 Page novel. \n\nAt least these are my thoughts. I think I should mention that I am a dude, so my views of female representation are not the same as a woman's and I never claimed they are. These are just my ideas and I am open to criticism. Lawrence Of Arabia is an example of why not every media should pass the Bechdel Test for its own sake. There is no way to fit women into the narrative without feeling forced. It's a story of men. Women don't have even a single spoken word, and how they could have? Anyone who watched the film knows why.",

He is recently divorced and I haven't seen him much lately because COVID. I've only met his new girlfriend a few times but she's very nice and friendly and the whole family likes her. When I got there they were already a few drinks in, so they both were a little loose-lipped and more open than usual.

I have a car and a decent job permanently working from home right now, I'm in a very good field and have a degree from a well-known university, but I've got a shit ton of student debt and I'm trying to build some experience so I can get a kick-ass job that will ensure I can live comfortably once I move out. So I'm planning on staying here for a couple more years. I have pretty much zero dating experience, not a virgin but I'm still way less \"experienced\" compared to everyone else my age. I don't have much of a social life either, if I go out to do something, it's with family, but I still have a friend who lives in the area who I'm trying to stay in contact with, but I'm pretty bad at that kind of thing so I'm not sure how long that will last. \n\nI'm really not building a good case for myself, am I? I guess that's the point of this post really, these are things I know I need to fix, but at this point in my life they really can't be fixed without a mountain of effort and a lot of time. I know nobody's perfect and there are probably tons of people who don't have their shit together as well as I do that go on dates all the time, but for the longest time I've felt like I just have too many dealbreakers for girls my age and I'm better off saving myself the wasted energy/constant rejection of trying to date and instead filling my time with work and solo hobbies. Yeah, honestly I'm pretty lonely and depressed, but what else can I really do for the time being?\n\nI don't think my uncle's girlfriend knows any of this about me except for the career stuff and living situation, but still, her broaching the subject just messes with my head and makes me wonder whether I'm needlessly self-sacrificing, and that I'm more \"dateable\" than I realize? Then again, she's a lot older than me and she probably doesn't understand the current landscape for people my age, so maybe her optimism is misplaced? Can anybody else here weigh in on this? Feel free to ask questions to gain more context, I have a tendency to make lengthy posts and I'm trying to cut down and be brief.\n\n\nTL;DR Uncle's girlfriend trying to be matchmaker, I don't know whether my self-esteem is shit and I have a chance of being successful in dating or if I'm being wise and saving energy/preserving mental health by waiting to move out of parent's house/gaining dating experience You sound way too critical of yourself . Have some confidence! Everyone has student debt, no one cares how experienced in bed you are, you've got great things going for you. Why not out yourself out there?",

            "text": "In our brain we have different chemicals that help us know what we want and can do.\n\nDopamine is a chemical that is related to attention, motivation and planning. So when you go to the bar you get a dopamine kick (dopamine levels rise) and you find yourself motivated to head out. You look forward to it.\n\nBut next morning you got work, and you are super hungover and tired. Its next to impossible. Your dopamine levels are very low, and therefor you find it hard to get started on things.\n\nPeople with bad dopamine regulation, as in their dopamine levels are not stable, often find themselves completely unable to get started on doing importang things, or find themselves completely unable to prevent themselvea from starting something. This is what ADHD is. A dysregulation of dopamine, and its why people with ADHD can either be completley absent from a class, or so completely engulfed by it that they dont even realize time is passing.\n\nA stimulant, stimulates these sorts of systems. Your brain is parts of whats called the Central Nervous System. And a stimulant increases the production of for example, dopamine. This is why amphetamine is often seen are performance enhancing. It can make you more motivated, focused, and happy. For people with ADHD, amphetamine is a common medication since it raises their dopamine levels to normal levels, so they can find motivation and starting energy to go to class, or do the dishes. For someone withour ADHD, their dopamine levels become higher than normal, and they therefor become high. They may find completely mundane things the be the most interesting, like the dust on a rug.\n\nA stimulant is just a drug that increases the effectivness of your brain. It increases motivation, energy, focus and all that. The opposite is a depressant. A depressant makes your thoughts unordered, you lose control of muscles, find it hard to walk and may get tired. Alcohol is a common depressant. Depressants can be used to treat pain and anxiety.\n\n\nWell known stimulants are:\n\n- Amphetamine (also called \"speed\", used for ADHD)\n\n- Methamphetmine (also called just \"meth\" or \"crystal meth\")\n\n- MDMA (another type of amphetamine, commonly called \"ecstasy\" or \"molly\")\n\n- Methylphenidate (Used for ADHD)\n\n- Cocaine\n\n- Nicotine\n\n- Caffeine\n\n\n\nWell known depressants are:\n\n- Alcohol\n\n- Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety and sleep issues)\n\n- Cannabis\n\n\n- opioids, some of which include;\n\n\n-  Morphine (used for pain relief)\n\n-  Heroin\n\n-  Fentanyl \n\n-  Methadone\n\n\n\nI apologize for any spelling errors, im typing on my phone.

Given status quo, de-growth is radical politics. It's definitely not political thinking the average person will be familiar with. Most contemporary (?) people build their fundamental political assumptions on capitalist realism. \n\nTo me \"smokescreen\" is pejorative, and I don't think that fair because it's the audience that is missing the full picture. It's not being concealed. Google definition: \n\n&gt; _smokescreen:_ a ruse designed to disguise someone's real intentions or activities.\n\nIt's a bit of an aside, but it's kind of strange to even consider \"de-growth but in a world without any environmental issues\". The environment is such a fundamental part of human existence, and thus political reality, that treating it as a political football in some fight between Capitalism and Socialism is to really underweight how important it is to build a political system that keeps the environment healthy.\n\nSocialists aren't using environmental collapse to smuggle in their socialist politics. Socialist can use the escalating environmental collapse to reify the validity of their core political principles and call into question the validity of opposing ideology's principles.",

I'm wonder whether many of you were harmed by the idiocies that took over so many school systems when \"No Child Left Behind\" began to corrupt the integrity of modern American education?\n\nEvery one of my large circle of friends from a number of countries is officially ranked as either \"gifted\" or \"genius\" (or their country's equivalent terms) and has proven to do well in life, but I know they have been successful as they would define success because all of them are past their middle 30s -- and this means they also avoided most of the \"No Child Left Behind\" degradation of public schooling and they escaped the burden of helicopter or snowplow parents who value labels over truth and prestige over honest self-esteem when it comes to their children.\n\nSo I wonder if this reddit is for those people who are young enough to have gone through the U.S. school system after its notions of gifted had lost all scientific accuracy and become more of a \"participation ribboon\" given to silence the lawyers of helicopter or snowplow parents and their deeply \"karen\" ways of objectifying their own children.\n\nAgain, I apologize if anyone is offended by what I have written. I'm in my low thirties. \n\nBack when I was in gifted program, to my knowledge there was no way a 'Karen' could use the school and make force them to put the child into the gifted class. A kid had to pass a test, and they either passed it failed. Also, not every gifted child I knew did stellar in school anyway. \n\nAlso, not everyone who is gifted or a genius will succeed in conventional ways.

We make decent money, but have our obligations (primarily student debt).\n\nWe have a small but growing youtube channel that's focused on higher quality production travel/vacation videos, etc. This opportunity could very well be what we need to help that channel grow and truly have our \"dream jobs.\"\n\nNow being an overthinking realist, I have a hard time seeing how this could become a reality. My main concerns come down to finances and our animals.\n\nAs for our stuff, we could sell all of what we don't want to keep in storage, including our vehicles, and have ourselves a fairly decent savings account for when/if we decide to come back and live on land. Not so worried about \"stuff.\" As for the house, our mortgage is fairly low and renting it out could become a small source of passive income for us (highly desirable part of town for young families). While that would net probably $500/month in passive income, we need more to be able to help with expenses on the boat, and to pay student debt (need around $900 per month for loans alone). \n\nI work primarily in graphic design/marketing, but do a lot of videography and photography. All things that can be done online and my current job may even possibly allow me to work remote if I were to ask, so that could actually work itself out. My wife does more clerical/insurance/coordinator work but I'm sure she could find something. How feasible is it to find a steady online job that can be done at sea? I imagine the balance of having/not having wifi may be tricky, especially if a remote/online job were to require frequent communication/zoom calls? How reliable are satellite wifi options out at sea? \n\nAs for the animals, that'd be one the hardest parts. Our cat is the coolest cat and he's been with me since 2013. I feel I could find him a good home with someone we know and be ok with that, as I'm more of a dog person. Our dog is the best dog either of us have ever had. Super smart, super friendly, very loyal and just an all around great dog (he's a border collie mix). I don't know that we could easily give him up to anyone, even if it's just for a year or two. My mom also has 2 golden retrievers that I believe they plan to bring aboard. What are the associated costs/hurdles to sailing with a dog? Let alone 3 dogs? I hear there are costs just to even anchor outside of some countries with a dog? \n\nHow likely is it for us to make this dream a reality? I'm worried we're not at the right time in our lives financially, but if we can secure income it just might be manageable. There's a lot to process with considering this even being a possibility so I figured I'd see if others have been through similar decision making processes and fulfilled their dreams. Thanks! I\u2019ve found dogs don\u2019t like being on the water unless used to it from an early age\u2026 Is there room on a catamaran even a 40\u2019 for golden retrievers? Good luck! I\u2019d leave animals home, unite when you return. \nI think the dogs, all 3 would hate it.",

An increasing gap between the market cost of the underlying and the long term realized returns that the investment gives, propped up by some outside force be it fraud like CDOs being improperly rated or governmental policy in monetary inflation. Also marked by an increase in fraud by sending overvalued commodities into the market in order to meet quotas set by the extraneous force propping up the inflation. \n\nThese set of standards fit not only most major tradable markets but also human beings in general, peoples value is hyped up to them through participation trophies and no child left behind with a decreasing focus in developing tangible skills. and we flood the market with degrees that teach no tangible skills but are guaranteed by the extraneous force (government accredited college giving out joke degrees) \n\nThis bubble is coming to a collapse on the same wave as commodities which is interesting as well The student loan/education bubble is gonna be nasty once it pops. Almost majority of people who graduate today have student loans that range from $30k and up with no decent job prospects available that can sustain these loans. It\u2019s like every student is a business entity that took out debt to invest in him/herself in hopes for generating higher cash flows or income once the degree is obtained. But reality is there are not enough high paying jobs for every degree holding person so most people will go bankrupt (many are already going through defaults).\n\nA college degree isn\u2019t for everyone. Just because the government made it easy for u to go to college through loans doesn\u2019t mean you should go to college. This is the same sub prime mortgage scenario all over again, except we have subprime degree holders with no real skills or real intelligence. \u201cHouses only go up\u201d. Now we been touting for more than a decade \u201cCollege Education will only make your income go up\u201d. I\u2019m afraid we hit the road block with this one. As we are seeing most people with college degrees are not able to make enough money to sustain their payments because you guessed it, college degree doesn\u2019t guarantee a higher income for the majority of people. People are having a hard time finding a good job because employers know a degree isn\u2019t enough or an indication of competence. People thought getting a degree will make you automatically qualified for your field, which is wrong. Most high paying fields require intelligence, diligence and being a self-starter. 90% of my engineering classmates were dumb and don\u2019t deserve to be engineers, including myself. We have engineering degrees, but we aren\u2019t good engineers. For me I hate it that\u2019s why I\u2019m not that enthusiastic or good at it. And guess what? They aren\u2019t gonna find decent engineering jobs, a hiring manager can smell these type of people from a mile away.\n\nSo to conclude, there is an education market bubble waiting to explode, just trying to gauge when and how to short it.",

Pfizer did not invent a covid-19 vaccine. \n\nI think if you make overcharging for drugs these companies didn't invent but purchased patents for and use unscrupulous legal means to maintain the patents less profitable, then a profit seeking corporation will look to investing in r&amp;d and inventing new drugs that are profitable because they increase public health. \n\nI think patent trolling and buying doctors to prescribe a certain pill is stifling innovation and removing the incentives of that business model will dramatically increase pharmaceutical innovation. The Sakler/Shkreli model of pharmaceutical innovation needs to go away. The same logic applies whether or not Pfizer did the R&amp;D in house or they had an in-licensing deal as with BioNTech. Pharma companies will pursue a drug (either through internal R&amp;D or in-licensing) if they expect they can make a profit. If you uniformly cut profits 20%, that means pharma companies won't pay as much to in-license new molecules, since the expected return on their in-licensing investment is now much lower. This gives less incentives for startups to work on risky new technologies, since now they know they won't make as much money when their molecule is in-licensed.",

            "text": "Advice needed: husband won't go to routine medical appointments If my husband had to go to the doctor, I made the appointment and either I or our daughter went with him. If I couldn't be there in person, I sent a detailed letter with my daughter. Why? If Hubby went alone, he would say \"I don't know why I am here, My wife made me come. I am fine.\" He would say this even if his arm was only attached by a little piece of skin and he was bleeding everywhere. It drove me nuts. Sadly, he noticed a lump in his neck and then developed severe back pain. By the time it made a drastic difference in his life (pain made him go from 15,000 steps a day to less than 5000 almost overnight), enough for the doctor to notice, he had cancer everywhere. The lump in his neck was a metastatic tumor. One of his vertebrae was eaten through with cancer and replaced by the tumor, which caused the back pain. It was pancreatic cancer. The first appointment about this was in May. He died that August. It was excruciatingly painful. I am so thankful that it was so fast. \n\nWhen I was about 16, my mother got a call from our dentist. Dad had an appointment but didn't show up. Dad and I both have severe anxiety about dentists. The dentist Dad had growing up, and the one I went to as a kid, didn't believe novacaine was needed. So he would give you a little of it (so he could charge for it) but not enough to actually stop the pain. I once saw this dentist slap a child for biting when the dentist drilled into his gums by mistake. I loathe going to the dentist and it totally freaks me out. We had moved to a new state and the dentist who called was very different. He wouldn't even give a novocaine shot until he was sure the topical numbing gel was working. He also used laughing gas, and then told stupid jokes to see if it worked. \n\nMom made a new appointment and drove Dad to it. She waited outside to make sure he went in. He went into the first door and then waited in that little area between the first and second door until Mom left. Then he walked home. Another appointment was made and I was asked to drop him off at the dentist. Again he went in the first door and then walked home as soon as I left. Mom was pissed when the dentist called. She and the dentist had a chat and another appointment was made. Dad went to that one. The dentist prescribed valium for Dad to take an hour or so before the appointment. Mom had meetings and classes all day, so I got to take Dad to the dentist and then pick him up. He was so funny when he was high on valium. After that, he took valium before any dental appointment for a few years. \n\nWith other things, like having leg or back or shoulder pain, Mom often rubbed Dad's legs or whatever while they watched tv or read before going to sleep. If Mom thought it was needed too frequently, and Dad was griping a lot, she would refuse to rub the sore body part until he went and talked to the doctor about it. That usually worked in less than a week.",

            "text": "So I've been seeing a lot of the people on this subreddit go about and laugh at the notion that Star Trek is Socialist despite decades, and I definitely mean, *decades* of proof otherwise.\n\n&gt;The Federation has no Money\n\nThis one should be very clear to anyone who's watched Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and Next Generation as well, but it was plainly spelled out in DS9 that the Federation doesn't use currency whatsoever within the bounds of the Federation. The only modicum of exchange they have is credits they use to barter with foreign powers, and those within the Federation who deal in exchange.\n\n&gt;The Federation is a Centrally Planned Economy\n\nWhile this looks very different from our modern economy, the Federation owns every science station, every space station, funds every colonization effort, every hospital, provides food, etc... They are, by all accounts, a centrally planned economy with distinct freedoms given to their individual planets and peoples.\n\n&gt;The Federation's Freedoms Are Not Proof Against Socialism\n\nFor those of you who doesn't actually study polisci, Socialism is an economic model, one which can be paired with any system of governance, and that includes Democratic ones-as we see exist in the Federation. The sort of totalitarian nightmares that exist under China and the Soviet Union aren't the only means by which Socialism is practiced, and one can gesture towards numerous societies in both the past and present, including Monarchies, Theocracies, Tribal Cultures, and even modern Democracies that all varied on the scale of Socialist.\n\nThe people of the Federation are free because of Democracy, they are Democratic Socialists.\n\n&gt;The people own the means of production\n\nUnder Socialism, the people own the means of production. The Federation, being Democratically Socialist, would mean that the workers own the means of production via elections which we never learn much about, but we know there are presidents *and* elections. Thus, since the government runs everything (as laid out before), and the government is voted in by the people, they are representatives of the people who own the means of production.\n\n&gt;\"The Federation isn't Socialist, it's just Post-Scarcity\"\n\nI've seen this argument a few times and while it is correct in that the Federation is a post-scarcity society, to say the Federation isn't post-scarcity by this metric is like saying Mercantilism and Capitalism are two totally different things. They are similar enough that we group them into a category together; Capitalism is just the evolution of Mercantilism, just as the Federation would at least be seen as the evolution of Socialism.\n\n&gt;The Truth\n\nThere is so much evidence as to the Socialism in Star Trek it's unbelievable that someone could claim otherwise. It doesn't matter what your own political views are, the evidence is right there.\n\n&gt;\"The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth, whether it's scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth! It is the guiding principle on which Starfleet is based, and if you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened, you don't deserve to wear that uniform.\"\n\n\\~Captain LeanLuc Picard The only thing we know for sure is that the Federation isn't practicing Ferengi capitalism, that doesn't mean they don't have their own version of capitalism.  \nWhy else would Sisko's father continue to run a restaurant, or Picard's family run a winery?  Obviously private businesses still exist.",

The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)\n\n\nFeminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.\n\n\nLeftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist\u2019s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.\n\nWords like \u201cself-confidence,\u201d \u201cself-reliance,\u201d \u201cinitiative,\u201d \u201centerprise,\u201d \u201coptimism,\u201d etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone\u2019s problems for them, satisfy everyone\u2019s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser. I'm going to go ahead and say that there is a sliver of truth in this, but it applies to all overly political people, conservative and liberal.",

So let us know your thoughts. We are all ears!\n\nWe are upgrading and rebranding SafePanda to be on PCS v2. We will be taking this opportunity to rebrand and update the tokenomics to better align with the vision and projection that AnjiEco is going.\n\nWhy upgrade and why now?\nWe have a few limitations that have confronted us as we progress the AnjiEco.\n\n- With our liquidity pool being on PCS v1 we have investors swapping with the wrong pool. We also cannot swap directly our tokens for other tokens listed on AnjiSwap that have their LP on PCS v2.\n\n- Our Total Supply has been meet with listing issues as some don\u2019t support the decimals. We also want to be taken seriously by smart investors who are interested.\n\n- SafePanda\u2019s tokenomics are great but we think we can make more exciting financial incentives for our investors and charities. \n\n- The back-end of AnjiSwap has some exciting stuff that we want to link to the token to benefit our investors. \n\n- Now is the right time. We have the market looking more promising and with the development of AnjiSwap and the Ecosystem, we can now push this powerful defi technology with the new upgrade.\n\n- Aggressive marketing will be more effective and can be made in this market!\n\nWhat\u2019s this new token?\nWe are calling it ANJI token. Makes sense right?! And it will better reflect the altruistic digital economy we are building. \n\nWe want to mature and be a logical investment for smart purpose-seeking investors. Losing the \u201csafe\u201d in our name will help us differentiate ourselves from comparable tokens.\n\nWhat are the changes?\nThis is where it gets exciting! \n\nTokenomics\nThe tokenomics are going to shift a little with the aim to provide rewards for holders that are more tangible. We are doing either BNB or BUSD rewards that are generated in a couple ways. \n\n2% of each transaction is distributed to holders in the form of BNB or BUSD reward. This better negates the turbulence of the defi space. You can put this back into buying more Anji Listed tokens with a reduced fee or take it out and do what you will. 1% of all transactions will also be put into static rewards, so your holdings can still grow over time.\n\n3% will go to the LP, 2% will go to marketing and development and of course 2% will go to us making a change into the world. \n\nWe have also made some great advancements in the AnjiSwap which will also generate funds for Anji holders. We have replaced and circumnavigated the PCS transaction fee with our own. This was not easy and it\u2019s very exciting for us. We have in theory created a unrestrictive DEX, and the funds generated from this will be shared with Anji Holders. You effectively become a shareholder of our growth. This deserves its own explanation but we will keep this short for now.\n\n\nTotal Supply: 10,000,000,000\nWe are reducing the supply. This will help with listings and allow us to be understood as a serious and powerful token. 1 quadrillion to 10 billion.\n\nBenefits\nGovernance. Shape and vote the future of AnjiEco and our charity work.\n\nBNB/BUSD Rewards. Earn and choose to invest in tokens listed on AnjiSwap\n \nLower transaction fees. As a holder you will pay less fees to use AnjiSwap.\n\nStatic Rewards. Earn over time more tokens and strengthen your position. \n\nHow do I get involved?\nWe will providing a interface where you can send your tokens and we will be sending you the equivalent in the new token once launched.\n\nWith the new supply you will receive:\n100,000 SPND = 1 ANJI\n\nDon\u2019t worry, this will become equivalent in value through the tokenomics.\n\nAs you know the LP of SafePanda is locked. So with the given tokens we will drain that LP and use it for the new LP when required. This will also be used towards listings on non-PCS platforms and / or marketing.\n\nWe will have plenty of time for you to upgrade your SPND tokens. We don\u2019t want anyone to be disadvantaged.\n\nWith that all done and the market ready for this, we are excited to propel our project into the future of defi as we are here for a long time. Not just a good time. \n\nWith this rebrand we are also expanding our charity focus beyond just Pandas. They will remain our mascot and we will be applying our charity work to a wider animal conservation effort.\n\nHeavy marketing and a big push to onboard more tokens to the AnjiSwap only means Anji holders become true shareholders in a project that is seeking to make a powerful and long term impact on the earth. What do I do with my safe panda tokens then?",

For the record Brida was a pretty big villain in the books so if you don't like that arc you can't really blame the show bc that plotline came from the books.

You should also relaize that nations like Libya were already in civil war before the Europeans gave them intel on Gaddafi's whereabouts, what happened after is all on the Libyans. You should also realize that the there was no non-expansion pact, it was said in passing by Clinton but never signed, something Russians don't actually get because they are so used to dictators setting policy. You should look this up, nations in which the US intervened on the request of the government had most casualties against civilians committed by the soldiers of that nation that was allied with us.

Some of us appreciate the technology of blockchain and crypto too, but everyone is here to escape this rat race we're all living of working 9 to 5 all year long and still worrying about tomorrow expenses after many years of work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour portfolio is definitely red by now and I see some around being scared, or feeling let down. Almost like this thing never happened before or like this market isn't supposed to be volatile. That's actually the beauty of it, let me explain.\n\nWe, like now, had China FUD every year. We had every type of FUD you could think of in the past, and still look where crypto is now. You could even take stocks as a comparison if you want. Some big guy would come and mess things up, but every damn time we go back up. **Higher.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFact is you should be grateful of the dips, not scared, because you can now buy lower. It can also go even lower, but then you should buy again. If you lack the money just wait for your time, it's ok, we've all been there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone is a genius in the bull market, but dips and bears is where you really want to be smart, by buying.

Volunteers were sent to Yugoslavia.  Chechnya itself was an extremely strange war, there were problems with who is one's own, who is a stranger, and plus there were two Chechen wars.  In general, this situation is extremely shitty and strange in fact.  Everyone lies, absolutely everything.  They lie in different ways and it is extremely difficult to find out the truth for sure.  We understand that they pour shit into our ears, but it is poured into absolutely everyone.  Agree that it is too much to ban the conditional Dostoevsky or Tchaikovsky from universities.  With Donbass, the situation is even more complicated.  I have friends who fled from there, according to their stories, they also had a very hard life.  In Ukraine in 2014 there was Russophobia, that's for sure too.  On their Maidan, people were shouting, whoever doesn\u2019t jump is that Muscovite (an insulting name for Russians), Moskal to dick, and so on.  I'm not trying to make our government look good, really.  I understand that this is fucked up.  But Ukraine definitely bombed Donbass in peaceful cities.  In Ukraine, there was definitely Russophobia, in Ukraine they definitely worshiped Bandera (a collaborator from the Third Reich), and in Ukraine there are definitely Azov and Aidar battalions, which are neo-Nazi groups officially part of the Ukrainian army.  Everyone lies too much and everything is absolutely debatable.  For participating in protests, they don\u2019t give up to 15 years, this is definitely a lie.  Well, Russia did not take the Donbass.  What is happening in Ukraine is happening both because of the Russian government and because of the Ukrainian one.  And here and there ass.  If only it all ended quickly, just this whole conflict that has been going on since 2014. Our government is most afraid of NATO.  Even Crimea was taken by Russia, out of fear that Ukraine would join the EU and NATO, because then NATO would have absolute control in the Black Sea. but I hope that our leaders will someday find common ground.  in general, the main problem of the world is that everyone pursues only their own interests, not taking into account the interests of others.

Especially since they border 2005, the most undoubtably Gen Z year, and 2007, the year the birth rates peaked. It also explains why I believe Core Z is 2004-2008, and that Generation Z as a whole is from 1999-2013:\n\n* They were born in 2006, the year where digital media was starting to become more prominent, and analog was on its last legs.\n* They began their childhood after Obama was elected, the Electropop Era began, and the Great Recession ended.\n* They were in elementary school when smartphones surpassed feature phones in sales, when digital downloads surpassed CDs in sales, when the Iraq War ended, during Sandy Hook, Obama\u2019s second election, the rise of influencer culture with the release of Vine, the eigth generation, the beginning of the Political Crisis Era with Crimea Annexation, Gamergate, Ferguson, rise of ISIS, gay marriage being federally legalized, Trump announcing his campaign, as well as during the rise of modern meme culture, and during Trump\u2019s 2016 election, as well as they primarily spent their childhood between 2012-2016, which was Core 2010s.\n* They were the last to begin their teens in the 2010s, though will spend most in the 2020s.\n* They were in middle school for Parkland and the March for our lives which fully began Gen Z as an identity , release of Fortnite and TikTok, Trump impeachment, Climate Strikes, start of COVID-19 and George Floyd Protests.\n* They entered high school after COVID-19 started, and are in high school during the 2020 election, and will be when James Webb launches next year, which could be historic, as well as will primarily spend their teens after the post-pandemic era begins, and are the only year to spend all of high school within the first half of the 2020s.\n\nIn conclusion, the Class of 2024 are the Ultimate Zoomers.

Where Benny at tho? Kanye has a good verse, but was that Royce 59 near the end, where's   \nhis verse? but whatever... it was cool)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* NEVER ABANDON YOUR FAMILY\n\n(808s and Heartbreak vibes right here... it does lowkey sound like a demo but it's still fine, its   \nalways good to express yourself)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* JESUS LORD\n\n(I dont know what those first 30 seconds of the song was, but this whole song, WOOOOOO!!!! Ye   \ncould've taken it by himself but everyone did well. Jay Elec, Jadakiss, Styles P &amp; Sheek had strong   \nfeature verses)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I KNOW GOD BREATHED ON THIS\n\n(why does some parts of the song remind me of Yeezus, thats crazy, but this song is pretty good,   \nmaybe its only flaw is the repeated chorus over and over, its good but it does get weary over time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* TELL THE VISION\n\n(am I tripping or does it sound like Pop Smoke's original verse of We Made It was ripped with some   \nAcapella maker? Like I can hear the drill parts on the song as his verse goes on, idk what that was, it   \nneeds 2 or 3 kanye verses only if you ask me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* JAIL\n\n(Another song with an 808s Heartbreak vibe. Now even though I like this song and everything   \nabout it, it could have 1 Kanye rap verse with 20 bars then Jay-Z's verse then Ye and Jay going      \nback-and-forth in the 3rd verse; we can keep the hook with the choir as well... maybe add a small   \namount of drums or not)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* LORD I NEED YOU\n\n(Not much to say, its brilliant as is)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* HURRICANE\n\n(now this updated beat took me beyond suprise, I knew this song when it was still called 80 Degrees   \nand only had Kanye on it, but it's cool, The Weeknd &amp; Sunday Service Choir had a brilliant hook, Lil   \nBaby had a cool verse, coulda kept Big Sean on this as well, Kanye was cool even though the hmm-   \nmmm-mmm was kinda troll-ish but not really, it is a good song tho, woulda love the OG beat but   \nyeah... the song MOON should come after this song, its just right that it turns out that way)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 24 / WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY\n\n(this would be a perfect intro for this album, I love it as it is)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND\n\n(I feel like all it needs is a Kanye rap verse after the chorus then end with the chorus... would be a   \nbrilliant way to end the album)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI LIKE THIS VERSION OF THE ALBUM FOR THE MOST PART, BUT IT COULD PROBABLY USE SOME TWEAKING... I think it's sound better when it's mixed and mastered and sequenced *grabs gun*",

In the wake of these shortcomings, however, you'll find incredible character acting and a beautifully bizarre plot. And, most importantly, Dana Carvey is pure magic.\n\nI concede that \"Master of Disguise\" is no Oscar-winner, but the fact that it scored 1% on RT is baffling to me. It easily deserves 60-75%. Change my view. Have you rewatched the movie recently? Because I have, and let me tell you, it is not good. The jokes are as low-brow as it gets. The disguises are well into racism, even given the time period. And overall, the movie is just boring. \n\nDana Carvey is good at funny voices.

            "text": "Amazon Synod Megathread: Part XX It baffles me the level of despair this simple stuff has produced. The Church has a long standing tradition of incorporating local religious beliefs and elightning them under the light of the Gospel. This is not new. If you read Guaman Poma, written by a newly converted inca just after spaniards arrived, you can see that this was the MAIN way of evangelization. You can also see fragments of them in many dates of our religious festivities and symbols. Sure, nowadays we just see some aestethic and dates, but that's just because the method worked.\n\nAccording to some sociologists on LA (catholic sociologists, that is, like Pedro Morand\u00e9) the culture of LA can be defined by a dialectic nature, product of a lack of history. There is a indigenous history and an iberic history, but people mostly aren't any of those, but a mix of them. This 2 (and sometimes 3, in territories with more afrodescendants) roots are imposible to fully synthesize. So LA culture would be defined by a 'barrock dialectic'. This dialectic is never solved, as there is not a history that merges both roots, not original myth (like in a hegelian dialectic or marxism), so you just live with it.\n\nCatholic religious practices, specially in indigenous context, are one of the best examples of this dialectic in LA. I was once in a festivity where a european franciscan priest (who work for many many years in the Andes) make an associatiom between mary and the figure of the Pachamama. I was baffled and complicated by it at first, but when you understand how the missionary work was done for centuries you start to understand it, nd appreciate.\n\nThat doesn't mean that this methodology is excempted of risks. Of course they are. Idolatry is a possible consequence of this method, but a figure of the pachamama is not idolatry by itself, unless you ignore the centuries of tradition and work of missionaires around the world. Pentecostal churches have used, for example, an opposite aproach, calling for the suspension of any symbol or belief who is not associated with their doctrine. And soemtimes, it works. \n\nI understand this might baffled you, specially if you are not acostumed to this, just as it baffled me the reaction by some european and northamericans. But please, don't desperate. This is neither new, nor 'modern'. It's not idolatry (at least not by itself, although I admit the risks). This is the way the Church became a part of LA ethos. This is the tradition of the Church in America.",

We are not only supposed to be a nation of laws, but a nation ruled by them as well.\n\nTherefore, I submit the following;\n\nGeorge W Bush should be charged with negligent homicide in the deaths of 450k Iraqi civilians. The word \"criminal\" is the only word to describe the incompetence shown by his administration in the invasion and administration of Iraq. An investigation should also take place to ascertain whether other members of the Bush administration should be charged for crimes committed during this invasion, from malfeasanceness to financial impropriety, and potential self-enrichment that would have occured due to the invasion and occupation.\n\nBarack H Obama, Donald J Trump, and Joe R Biden should be charged with capital homicide in the deaths of Syrian military personnel and the civilians caught up in the illegal bombing of Syria against Assad's forces for which they are responsible for ordering. These Presidents had no legal authority to attack Assad's military. It was not legal under the authorized use of force for Iraq. It was not legal under the authorized use of force act against Al Qaeda after 9/11 as Assad and his regime was in no way responsible for nor provided any accommodation to Al Qeada. It was not within the war powers act as no Americans were under any threat by the Syrian regime. \n\nAdditionally, Barack H Obama should also be charged with the deaths of Libyan military forces and civilians, for the same reasons listed above, with all references to Syria and Assad replaced by Libya and Gaddafi, respectively.\n\nThese events have stained the reputation of the United States. No President is above the law. If the President does it, that does not mean it is automatically legal or just. Congress has refused to act to reign in these illegal actions. Only by the court of law is where I see justice can be done.\n\nHave at it. Do your best to destroy my PoV. War criminal is person who commits a war crime. Specifically those listed in Lieber Code, Hague and Geneva Conventions.\n\n[US has committed war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_war_crimes) and it's officers should be prosecuted and many have been.

Is it a choice or is it a law?\n\nI'm asking because I'm on a regimen of medications for mental health and with my current insurance I have zero copay for medications and therapy appointments, but after researching if I get my own insurance medications and appointments would be hundreds of dollars I simply don't have. The law mandates that insurance providers allow children to stay on their parents plan until age 26.\n\nBeyond that, it's more profitable for them to have their own separate plan.",

            "text": "The soldier example still misses the point. If they're talking about an injured soldier, they're still talking about a man as the focal point. The idea of 'something other than a man' is that the two women should either be talking about themselves as people or engaging in the actual plot without focusing on the plot of a man.  If Claire Temple and Karen Page are talking about whether Matt Murdock will live or die after getting his ass kicked, that's a failure of the test because Matt Murdock is still the focal point of the conversation and it's still a Murdock-driven story.\n\nThe test isn't about whether or not the female characters are good or bad characters, but whether the story focus gives the female characters their own storylines.\n\nAlso, Annihilation's a weird case where the characters aren't named because their names are intentionally omitted, not because they're nameless characters. When the test questions if they have names it's to discount throwaway characters so that a female protagonist ordering drive thru from a female cashier doesn't count.  Powepuff Girls has \"Him.\" Him is not his name. Nobody ever says his name. He's just... \"Him.\" That doesn't make him 'nameless.' It just means we're avoiding saying it. (Been a bit sorry) if two army nurses are talking about a patient (a random soldier) and that patient is a man then in my mind it has the same effect as two baristas talking about a missing shipment of coffee beans. It's two woman talking about there job, like people with jobs do.",

Especially since they border 2005, the most undoubtably Gen Z year, and 2007, the year the birth rates peaked. It also explains why I believe Core Z is 2004-2008, and that Generation Z as a whole is from 1999-2013:\n\n* They were born in 2006, the year where digital media was starting to become more prominent, and analog was on its last legs.\n* They began their childhood after Obama was elected, the Electropop Era began, and the Great Recession ended.\n* They were in elementary school when smartphones surpassed feature phones in sales, when digital downloads surpassed CDs in sales, when the Iraq War ended, during Sandy Hook, Obama\u2019s second election, the rise of influencer culture with the release of Vine, the eigth generation, the beginning of the Political Crisis Era with Crimea Annexation, Gamergate, Ferguson, rise of ISIS, gay marriage being federally legalized, Trump announcing his campaign, as well as during the rise of modern meme culture, and during Trump\u2019s 2016 election, as well as they primarily spent their childhood between 2012-2016, which was Core 2010s.\n* They were the last to begin their teens in the 2010s, though will spend most in the 2020s.\n* They were in middle school for Parkland and the March for our lives which fully began Gen Z as an identity , release of Fortnite and TikTok, Trump impeachment, Climate Strikes, start of COVID-19 and George Floyd Protests.\n* They entered high school after COVID-19 started, and are in high school during the 2020 election, and will be when James Webb launches next year, which could be historic, as well as will primarily spend their teens after the post-pandemic era begins, and are the only year to spend all of high school within the first half of the 2020s.\n\nIn conclusion, the Class of 2024 are the Ultimate Zoomers.

But didn't do the folowing: use hard drugs ( coke. meth. etc). have multiple sexual partner- I have and had one and we are married. \nBut I think if you try many things out of curiosity you eventually will want them at some point, you will crave them. Even if you won't become and addict and will want things every now and then.\n1.I started smoking first time in college just to be in the  company and liked the hit but not the bad breath. Boight my first pack when moved to a different country and split up with my the gf now wife. I was smoking 1 pack per week for a few weeks then less or if a friend offered some. No I smoke cigarettes nearly every weekend or a bit more often but also offerings. When I watch a smoking scene in movie I want to light one myself.\n2.As an adolescent I didn't like coffee apart from 3in1 and found it weird that some considered a good coffee one that is not sweet and could drink a few per day. Now I drink coffee everyday but can't explain why - just like and want it. natural americano with vegetarian milk and some sweets is my go to.\n3. I like sweets. But don't like the fact because of the health problems they cause and the unaturallity of so much sugar intake. \n4. My latest add on is 'spinnach' smoke first time yars ago and a couple of times in the last 2 years but lately I want to have a joint daily (even if one joint will last me for a week)). It became accesible so I'm tempted.\nThis being said I think I am an addict even if I'm in control of my urges this doesn't meant I will be able to keep the same level of control if I would try other unexplored things. I would have more things to want whether regularly or because of some events.\nSomehow being human means being an addict. And shouldn't try more things. So, are these things that you enjoy interfering in a negative way with your quality of life? If not, then I'm not sure how the occasional use of these things constitutes calling yourself and addict, although, if I'm understanding you correctly, it sounds like you're trying to say that you have an addictive personality, or a tendency that might lend to addiction, but I would suggest that those are different than actually being an addict.",

So there I am, with my laptop connected to the network, standing inside the main door with a long line of squids.. I mean Sailors. They all had to change their passwords. Had this officer come up and told me he had the perfect password that would exceed ANY requirements. Of man, punch it in. He does and off he goes.\r  \n\r  \n20 minutes later he comes back and walks right up to the front of the line. Tells me that he needs to redo his password because he \"must have typed it in wrong\". Oh really? Twice? Whatever. So I tell him \"I am sorry to hear that sir but, you must go to the back of the line as these password changes are mandated\". So he starts to get all uppity.\r  \n\r  \n\"Do you realize that you are talking to an officer in the United States Navy?\". Ohhhhhh no you didn't  just try playing the rank card on me (ex Army NCO with an attitude).\r  \n\r  \n\"Yes sir I do realize who you are, and while you are at it, you can address me as Mr. Robinson or Sir as required by your regulations when dealing with a civilian\". \"Now if you would kindly go back to the back of the line so that we can take care of this first round of password changes\".

Trusting US government that is known to the whole for their propaganda throughout history ( Not only US government but UFOs are in the spotlight in the US last few months)\n\n\nPeople are so naive and silly when it comes to this topic, even believing these \"witness testimonies\" just because \"people won't lie\" about that. A lot of videos here are so sketchy and vague but people still find a way to say that they are aliens, even though these objects don't do anything otherworldy. I watched 1000s of videos here and I've never seen a video that was clear enough that it couldn't be easily staged/faked where UFO is doing something that our tech couldn't do. It goes both ways, there are also many people invested in the unsubstantiated belief that UFO\u2019s and aliens are not real.",

            "text": "Hi \ud83d\udc4bOver the last few years, I've been attempting to fix my posture, specifically a hump/shelf/mound on my neck just below my shoulders. I used a lot of links and tips from Reddit, but I had a hard time finding a long term plan that addressed my issue at the core. After some physical therapy, I merged some of the exercises with my regular push/pull/legs gym routine. This ensured I actually did the PT exercises continually while still working toward my goals. I hope this helps if you're on your own journey.\n\n**Background**\n\nTLDR: 28 (F) with ongoing, untreated posture issues (forward head, winging) for several years. Went to physical therapy 1x/week for 3 months, followed a PPL program at the gym, flattened the fleshy speed bump.\n\nBefore + After [https://imgur.com/a/zqhDWTU](https://imgur.com/a/zqhDWTU)\n\n**Background**\n\nI\u2019ve always had poor posture from one thing or another. I was an DD cup by the time I started 9th grade, and I\u2019ve been wearing a 32G for several years. I strongly recommend the [r/ABraThatFits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/) for a supportive bra. I pretty much only wear the [Chantelle Lingerie Rive Gauche Full Coverage Underwire Bra](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/3035131) at this point.\n\nI began getting more frequent migraines, and my upper back would ache constantly, beyond DOMS. I felt like someone could kneel on my right shoulder blade and my mid-upper back would still be tight.\n\nI tried to get PT through my doctor\u2019s office, but it ended up being a bust. The clinic was geared more towards people recovering from major surgery.\n\nDue to COVID and a family emergency, I ended waiting almost another 10 months to find another clinic. I went with a local ATI that I could walk to from my house and that had early morning appointments. After I called, I asked my primary care physician to refer me. I had a $25 copay per visit, and I ended up going once a week for 3 months.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nThe physical therapist took about 15 minutes to identify my major areas and basic therapy plan. My shoulders rounded forward (e.g., \u201cwinging to the right\u201d) with an emphasis on my right side (dominant), creating a winging effect. Left untreated, this could lead to issues with my rotator cuff and shoulder, possibly surgery.\n\nThe first half of the initial visit involves a lot of questions and some mobility tests. I was super tight and just couldn\u2019t rotate back. This is part of the pre assessment, and I completed it twice over the 3 months.\n\n**Treatment**\n\nEach session was 1 hour. The first 5 minutes was a warm up on the hand bike thing. The physical therapist would check in with me about the exercises I was doing at home, any pain I was feeling. The next 15 or so minutes was (IMO, the best part) functional massage. Super intense, very targeted, borderline painful, but it really helped me throughout the session.\n\nThe remaining 40 or so minutes or so were dedicated to the previous 5 or so exercises + a few more. Just a heads up, the head PT saw one patient for the first 1/2 of their session and then met with their next patient, so you probably won\u2019t have 100% of the session with the lead PT. The idea of PT in a place like ATI is that the moves can be done mostly at home or at a gym. If I do my full routine of about 20 moves, it takes me about 25-30 minutes, and I try do them at least 3x a week, usually paired with Push/Pull from PPL.\n\nI\u2019ll do my best to link good examples of the exercises that helped me the most, but the best course of treatment is working with a trained professional. They can help you position your body and complete the exercises in a way that addresses the underlying skeletal muscular issues. You\u2019re working on retraining your body, and extra set of trained eyes is key. I\u2019m always working on my posture, but now I\u2019m thinking about flexibility, rotation, strength, and form. And avoiding a full shoulder replacement surgery.\n\n**Exercises**\n\n(Apologies to mobile users - there are lot of links here.)\n\nInstagram folks to check out\n\n* [@ thephysiofix](https://www.instagram.com/thephysiofix/)\n* [@ stopbackpain](https://www.instagram.com/stopbackpain/)\n* [@ ptvitals](https://www.instagram.com/ptvitals/)\n* [@ docjenfit](https://www.instagram.com/docjenfit/)\n* [@ kickassyoga](https://www.instagram.com/kickassyoga/)\n* [@ backpainguide](https://www.instagram.com/backpainguide/)\n* [@ backpainadvice](https://www.instagram.com/backpainadvice/)\n* [@ dr.giardina.dpt](https://www.instagram.com/dr.giardina.dpt/)\n* [@ dr.caleb.burgess](https://www.instagram.com/dr.caleb.burgess/)\n* [@ nomusclepain](https://www.instagram.com/nomusclepain/)\n* [@ schaefit\\_](https://www.instagram.com/schaefit_/)\n* [@ dr.surdykapt](https://www.instagram.com/dr.surdykapt/)\n* [@ dr.josh.elzey](https://www.instagram.com/dr.josh.elzey/)\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Foam Roller (go for a medium-long one)\n* Blank Wall\n* A doorway + a door\n* Loop Resistance band (you want one that is pretty long and not too resistant)\n* Theraband bands (the PT provided these for me)\n* A chair, bench, ottoman\n\n**Warm up/Cool Down**\n\n* Cat - Camel (cow?)

Exactly my point, if you\u2019re handling a claim wherein your insured is 50% liable for someone injuries. And those injuries are worth 50k, easily. But your insured has a 15k policy. That\u2019s not a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to offer $15k to the injured party. \n\nLiability is always taken into consideration, but, like you said, \u201cbig picture\u201d\u2026 the case is worth $50k. Your insured is 50% liable and has a $15k policy. The claimant gets $15k NOT $7.5k. \n\nThe exact same is for UBI. LIMITS of liability are not reduced by percentage of negligence when the case is worth more than the limits no matter the percentage of liability. \n\nThe only thing reduced by percentage of negligence is the overall claim value. Which is irrelevant to the available limits.",

The Focus System is getting an extensive rework to refresh the gameplay potential of Operators, movement, School identity and balance. \n\n**WHAT IS FOCUS?**\n\nFocus has been a lot of things over the years. What started in 2015 as a pivotal decision moment in Warframe\u2019s story has continually evolved into its own form of gameplay:**Convergence** was introduced alongside Focus Lenses to give players an added boost to collecting Focus, **Update 22: Plains of Eidolon** shook the system up to add new Focus School nodes and Way-Bound abilities, and **Update 22.6** attempted to bring the 5 schools\u2019 power levels closer together with numerous abilities reworked. \n\nAt its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy Warframe from the lens of another character. What we\u2019ve come to realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that while also bringing something fresh to the table!  \n\n\n**OPERATOR GAMEPLAY REWORK OVERVIEW**\n\nThe **Operator Gameplay** and **Focus School** reworks aim to improve the flow between Warframe gameplay and Operator gameplay, with the goal of encouraging players to swap more frequently between their Operator and Warframe to maximize the benefits received from both gameplay systems. \n\nAs with all our major system overhauls, we encourage you to give it some time in your own hands before delivering your constructive feedback! \n\nFor Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly, re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host; thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe. \n\nVoid Sling is the intended replacement of Void Dashes as a more fun and controllable system. In full transparency, the current state of sustained Void Dash movement has a spam-centric loop that we want to refine. We are very much approaching this like how we added Bullet Jump to Parkour: we want movement to be king, but better controlled. Current Void Dash does not provide easily controlled movement in the typical gameplay spaces. We are aiming to strike a balance to ensure good distance can still be covered, but some re-mastery will be required of this new movement system (much like having to learn Bullet Jumping)! \n\nAdditionally, Operator Transference has been re-engineered to be Client-authoritative to alleviate the common scenario of latency. Previously, Transference was Host-authoritative, meaning when Clients used Transference the responsiveness was determined by the round trip network latency. In order for the new Void Sling functionality to be more responsive, the switch was made to be Client-authoritative. \n\n**Void Dash to Void Sling**\n\nThe Operator sends a Void Sling of themselves and then Void Slings to it. It is the Operator\u2019s \u2018Double Jump\u2019. ***After its debut on Devstream #160 and following further playtesting, the team has since increased the overall speed of the Operator\u2019s Void Sling thanks to feedback.**",

Nothing\u2019s impossible when it comes to the Murdaugh family.\n\nMy head is REELING with the constant rumors and news reports surrounding Alex (ps - pronounced Al-ec) Murdaugh (mur-dock), Gloria Satterfield, misappropriated funds, Stephen Smith, and the new characters (such as Corey Fleming) we\u2019re being introduced to on the daily. With all of this said, sometimes it\u2019s best to take a deep breath (and maybe a shot of bourbon), refocus, and go back and start from the beginning. Ladies and gents, buckle up.\n\nAs many of you probably already know, the Murdaugh family has been a powerful, legal \u201cdynasty\u201d here in the Lowcountry since around 1910. Yep, over 100 years.\n\nRandolph Murdaugh Sr. (Alex Murdaugh\u2019s Great Grandfather), started the family law firm as a sole practitioner in 1910. Ten years later, he also became the local prosecutor.  According to the website for the 14th Circuit Solicitor's Office, \u201cAs soon as the position of Solicitor became an elected one in 1920, Hampton attorney Randolph Murdaugh Sr. was chosen for the job.\u201d Randy Murdaugh Sr. was only the beginning of the succession of Murdaughs that would serve as a Solicitor in the 14th Judicial Circuit.  Randolph Murdaugh Sr. was succeeded by his son, Randolph \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh (Randolph Jr.), who held the position until his retirement in 1986. Buster\u2019s son, Randolph Murdaugh, III (Alex\u2019s Dad), was elected and served for almost 20 years until he decided to go into private practice in 2005.\n\nAs it turns out, playing dirty on the legal side, using power for gain (regardless of what or who\u2019s damaged in the process), and behaving in a completely corrupt and selfish manner didn\u2019t start with Alex Murdaugh or his son(s). We can give that award to Alex\u2019s grandad, Mr. Randolph \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh (Randolph Jr.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Below is an excerpt from a** [United States Attorney Bulletin (November 9, 1956):](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2010/10/12/usab0423.pdf)\n\n**Conspiracy to Violate the Internal Revenue Liquor Laws**\n\n**United States VS Thompson, et al. S.C**\n\n&gt;\u201cIn June 1956 federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Randolph Buster Murdaugh, Haskell Thompson, and 27 other defendants with having conspired over a period of several years to violate the internal revenue liquor laws. The case attained wide notoriety in South Carolina because Murdaugh at the time of his indictment held the office of Solicitor for the 14th Judicial District of South Carolina\u2026  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Before the trial the Court, over the strenuous objection of the government, granted the defendants motion for disclosure of the names of the government witnesses. This was followed by very questionable practices on the part of some of the defendants and their attorneys during which government witnesses were threatened, attempts were made to influence them by promises of reward for themselves or members of their families and at least one attempt was made to intimidate or influence the United States Attorney...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Trial commenced on September 17, 1956 and continued daily until October 1, the Court remaining in session from 930 A.M until as late as 1030 P.M The defense resorted to some highly questionable tactics all apparently designed to bring about an acquittal or mistrial as to Solicitor Murdaugh, even at the risk of sacrificing the remaining defendants...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although acquitted, Solicitor Murdaugh was publicly castigated for his unethical practices by Judge Walter Hoffman of the Eastern District of Virginia who presided at the trial. The Judge deplored the fact that Murdaugh, who is an unopposed candidate for the office of Solicitor, and therefore assured of election, will on January 1 ,1957,  inevitably resume the office from which he resigned following his indictment.  Judge Hoffman indicated that, were he in Murdaugh\u2019s place, he could not go back and face his people much less resume public office. The Judge also felt It necessary publicly to call attention to the fact that it is a separate and distinct offense for anyone to threaten a person who has testified in court proceedings.\u201d\n\nLong story short - Randolph \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr. was indicted for tipping off a local bootlegger. Was he acquitted? Yep. But, based on the information throughout the federal bulletin and statements from the presiding judge, Randolph \u201cBuster\u201d Murdaugh Jr.\u2019s acquittal was likely a result of questionable practices, threats, and attempts to influence others by promises of rewards (even to the US attorney).\n\nBuster Murdaugh Jr. would never show or demonstrate an ounce of shame, regret, or embarrassment. He\u2019d sit in his fancy chair in his fancy office for another three decades before passing on the beloved family Solicitor role to his son, Randolph Murdaugh, III (Alex Murdaugh\u2019s dad).\n\nThis is a family who doesn\u2019t know how to NOT get their way because that\u2019s never happened. But you can\u2019t pay off, avoid, or threaten karma forever, right? They were apparently proud of the original Buster to pass on his nickname, to pass it on to a new generation.",

After much back and forth online about how the Evergrande situation would or wouldn't affect US markets, the answer was clear - DOWN WE GO! The S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) fell for its worst day since May. The Dow Jones (DIA) had its largest single-day drop since October 2020. The Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM) fell 3.2% and 3.4% respectively. \n\nIf you asked \"What's the Evergrande situation?\" *or* at any point today said \"Why is everything red?\", you may need to learn to read before investing in stocks. Evergrande is China's largest developer and is on the brink of default, which could cause mass damage to China's real estate market. As the world's second-largest economy, the effects could reverberate across global markets. \n\nThere's many, many differences, but could this be China's \"Lehman moment\"? Throw on top a rise in covid cases, the Fed meeting this week, a deadline to raise the debt ceiling or face government shutdown, *and* historically, the worst month for the market and we get this recipe for a continued pullback. \n\n Obligatory: these are not stock recommendations, **this does not constitute financial advice - if you need that kind of advice contact your broker**, I'm just analyzing unusual option data, (so if you don't see your favorite stonk, don't take it personally) please do you own DD, etc. etc. etc.\n\nI pull my data from a premium Market Chameleon account.

Makes me curious if the elevated activity is folks dumping options or opening discounted positions. OI and implied volatility implies that the majority of calls for DNN are being *sold,* as of Friday's close. \n\n**BITF -13.48% (+2.26%)**  No news. OI/IV implies both calls and puts at the $5 strike are being sold in high volumes, as of Friday. Interesting that the most active option is for $10. \n\n**NAK -6.94% (+0.88%)** No news. Would think NAK would rise with Gold on the rise today. OI/IV implies the October $0.50 calls are being sold more than bought. \n\n**APRE -4.15% (+24%)** Kinda went with the market all day. Currently going bonkers AH after presenting trial data. OI/IV from Friday shows calls being sold at the $10 strike for October. Those positions may be hurting tomorrow. \n\n**UEC -7.72% (+0.33%)** No news. OI/IV shows Oct $3 puts being sold, which is probably a good bet if you want to run \"the wheel\" and don't mind owning the stock. Overwhelming amount of options skew toward calls. \n\n**AMPE -8.89% (+/-0%)** Most active strike (Oct $0.5 put) has the highest activity at *super* cheap prices - $0.05/contract. The OI for this option going into today was a whopping **1.** The overwhelming majority of options are for October expiry. \n\n**ENDP -3.18% (-0.73%)** Single order for 8,177 of the most popular option under the condition \"Stock Contingent\". \n\n**OPK -3.81% (+0.01%)** Put/call ratio is up huge (14%) over the last 5 days. \n\n**BEST +2.82% (+1.37%)** After opening to a more than 20% gain, BEST spent the rest of the day bleeding the gain away. Curious that a China stock would rise today, given market conditions. BEST did see nearly 5x the average volume of shares traded today. \n\n**NXE -11.56% (+2.4%)** No news that I could find. Recent OI/IV shows a high number of $5 puts being sold. Either those positions suck to be in right now, or someone is OK with their cash secured puts. NXE has had elevated option activity 10 of the last 12 days. \n\n**DRV +1.31% (+1.72%)** This may be the most interesting one today. DRV provides 3x leveraged inverse exposure to an index of US REITS. Say *what?* Lemme explain - real estate goes down, this stock goes up. Look at the year chart. Nothing but down. Why? Real estate has been *stupid* hot. I don't know how many US REITs would feel any sort of residual effects from the Chinese real estate market. Would be interested to see if any of these options were held on to. \n\n**ZIOP +/-0% (+0.55%)** Call options dominate the open interest, and even those are down 15% over the last 5 days. \n\n**VSTM +1.81% (-1.07%)** After to opening to a 27% gain, VSTM gave nearly all of it back. The stock popped after announcing a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen. The most active option had a total open interest of 16 headed into the session. \n\n**CRTD -10% (+3.13%)** Can't find any reason for the drop or elevated option activity. More volume on the Oct $5 call than the total OI for that strike as of Friday. \n\n**GGB -2.38% (+/-0%)** No news, but the steel industry has been getting hurt a bit lately. \n\n**ADMP -6.36% (+/-0%)** No news that I could find. \n\n**ABUS -1.38% (+/-0%)** No news that I could find. \n\n**ATHX -5.44% (+1.44%)** No news that I could find. \n\n**SYBX +12.77% (-1.89%)** Announced positive phase 2 data. \n\n**RGS -5.19% (+1.82%)** No news that I could find. Call open interest is at some of the highest levels of the past 52 weeks, which says call options are being *bought* and option traders are bullish. \n\n**GRAY +4.86% (+/-0%)** No news. Had 2.5K more volume for the most active option than had been in the open interest.  \n\n**CRNT -4.63% (+0.92%)** Announced that it secured a contract to design and supply a microwave network in Indonesia to provide internet and telcom access to remote islands and regions. Total option open interest has dropped 70% over the past 5 days.\n\n**CHS +1.06% (+/-0%)** No news that I could find. Single order for 1,488 of the most popular option. \n\n**KRBP +2.6% (+/-0%)** No news. KRBP has had elevated option activity 8 out of the last 12 days. OI/IV shows that Dec $5 calls and Mar $5 calls are being sold more than bought. \n\n**ENVB +1.6% (-1.57%)** Announced that it's going to participate in some conferences blah blah blah. Looks like more than 1,500 bear call spreads set up in April with the $5 and $7.50 strikes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOof. Hope everyone's portfolio is OK\n\nboom Can someone tell me how the 2008 housing crash in the states affected China then?",

I can't abide that. Even the people who support the government over there. They have a reason to. None of us are any better in that regard, otherwise why the fuck would Biden get in or why the fuck did we sit back and allow Corbyn to get fucked on my side of the aisle? &gt; but look at how many people still defend the invasion of Iraq,\n\nEh, It\u2019s Wildly unpopular now.

The state controls the media and information so I belief that the people aren\u2019t properly educated to make good criticism of their government. At the same time, CCP defenders online like to tout that CCP is very popular and suggest that it\u2019s the will of the people. They also like to argue that people are indeed well educated on what\u2019s going on. So by their logic, the people of China are indeed guilty of all the atrocities of the CCP.",

The money isn't amazing ($44k a year + perks) but increases by a few grand a year as I go. Great life experiences and who knows what other opportunities it will lead to. \n\nDue to not working while studying + dealing with physical and mental health stuff over the years I only have $7.5k in Kiwisaver. Have this in a Milford Active Growth Fund.\n\nLooking at starting a pure aggressive fund separate to this to drip feed as I go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how/what to focus on with my income so I can make the best of my situation. I honestly feel like I'm behind compared to my peers and am really scared of my disease progressing and cutting my working life short so feel immense pressure to play catch up AND excel in the financial department over the next 10 or so years. \n\nInitially I was looking at funneling $1,000/m onto my loan and just working my ass off and getting that paid off in just over 3 years. Or do I just do $100/w and have it take longer but have more funds to use in other areas, be it investing or rainy day funds/kiwisaver.\n\nWould really appreciate any insight or suggestions or % formulas on distributing income. Even if anyone had any suggestion on books to read? I was thinking of the barefoot investor but open to more suggestions.\n\nMany thanks! Pay the minimum on your loan. Inflation will erode the real value. Assign 20$ a day after tax into your future investment.  No one in this country will deliver ouststanding investment returns(except property). A couple of other options are: options trading (higher risk/return but you will need to find a trader) orthere is buying shares in an indexed fund via stake or hatch will give better returns.This is long term strategy. This is not financial advice. Just making you  aware of a couple of other avenues.",

There may be good aspects of bad laws (expanding coverage eligibility), but that does not make the law good. Pretending that it's a good law reduces the effort to pass actual good laws that will expand coverage access to all Americans without forcing them to buy it. \n\n&gt;Republicans don't want opportunities for the common people, and Democrats tend to be too obsessed with bipartisanship.\n\nThen stop voting for Democrats and Republicans. You're not forced to buy it. You have to pay a tax for not having it. A tax to encourage people to be prepared for accidents. \n\nI wonder what you would have done if you had a serious medical injury and had been uninsured. I'm going to guess a significant portion of your bills would have been passed on to other paying patient. \n\nIt's a terrible system we all agree on that.\n\nSaying doing nothing was better than Obamacare, is idiotic. And saying they should have come up with something better is ignorant of how American politics works. Unfortunately if you can't make the companies affected happy, they'll pull money from senators, who then won't be able to get re-elected. And you might say well we need laws to take corporate money out of politics, but who is going to vote for that? The same politicians that rely on the corporate money? Its going to take a lot to get real changes to medicine we need. A pandemic and 600k dead wasn't even enough to make dent in medical policy.\n\nThe only real way to do it would be vote for people like Bernie Sanders who only take small donations, and even then its going to take a lot of people putting their money where their mouth is, prioritizing integrity above partisan issues, and a whole lot of ignoring all the social media lies and twisted facts. \n\nSo Obamacare is not perfect. But its is a good law, because in the messed up system, one party was able to provide some small relief from decades of mismanaged medicine, and until American's start prioritizing integrity in its candidates that's the best we'll get.",

            "text": "I finished a successful Glenn playthrough last night and afterwards I was thinking about just how bonkers his achievements were and how he would be regarded by history. So, I wrote this, exploring just that kind of thing! Spoilers for the President Glenn path obviously, and I fudged the fact that content ends and leaves things dangling as him winning a third term in office.\n\n----\n\nComing into office off the back of the most disruptive decade in American politics since the Civil War, inheriting the legacy of the astonishingly unpopular and constitutionally questionable policies of Strom Thurmond, the expectation was that the incumbent President would be one who would have to devote all their efforts to simply stabilizing the situation and beginning to restore some measure of trust and confidence in US politics. A competent, cautious man might have attempted just that. John Herschel Glenn Jr. Was not that man - Glenn was rather a man of vaulting ambitions and boundless optimism, who believed that the only way for trust and confidence to be restored was with the boldest vision he could imagine.\n\nGlenn\u2019s rise to the Presidency was almost as meteoric as the event which made him a household name; the veteran of the Second World War who went on to become a test pilot and thereafter the first man in space recalls he had no political ambitions before President Nixon\u2019s decision to defund NASA in the wake of the Reich\u2019s arrival on the moon in 1962. Glenn was, to be sure, distraught by losing this milestone achievement to the Germans, but he was far more upset by what he regarded as Nixon\u2019s total capitulation on all matters of space which stemmed from Kollner\u2019s historic steps on our lunar neighbor. Even after this his political ambitions were not about election but in his attempt to make enough of a fuss to see NASA\u2019s budget and remit protected, but it was soon clear to him that he could not achieve that in his existing capacities no matter how hard he tried. Here we see the twin, seemingly opposed character traits that would define Glenn\u2019s presidency; he came to the conclusion that he could only make the changes he thought necessary in elected office, preferably at a very high level, in the course of an afternoon, but once the decision was made he drew plans that spanned decades and exhibited the utmost patience in pursuing them.\n\nGlenn knew he would struggle to reach the Presidency from a standing start, and he further believed that even if he made it his lack of political experience would mean he would use the office inefficiently and be vulnerable to political manipulation by more experienced actors. So, he set his sights at a lower level, and announced his campaign for the governorship of Ohio in mid-1962. Ohio\u2019s favorite son would immediately attract criticism for what was regarded by many as a vanity project, but Glenn had prepared for this possibility - he had spent weeks working with friends, his wife Annie, and a small cadre of political advisors to draw up a suite of plans that he could pursue as governor, plans which were the kind of effective low-level policies that would help the average Ohioan in their day to day life. Storming out of the gates with a primary campaign to highlight these ideas, he rapidly quelled enough of the criticism to be seen as a legitimate and credible candidate, and that was all he needed. Though joining the Republican Party he was able to win over enough of the Democrat wing of the RDs to become the candidate for Governor, usurping presumptive candidate Jim Rhodes, and took up the race against the NPP. It was a close race - by the time November rolled around, the Nixon government had got its first taste of scandal and controversy, and it dented RD prospects nationwide. By less than a single percentage point, John Glenn won the race and had taken his first small step on his long plan.\n\nAs it happened, the events of the 60s would prove so disruptive that Glenn\u2019s timetable could be rapidly accelerated. Conversations with his early allies have told us he originally intended on pursuing the Presidency in 1972 or 76, depending on the political landscape at the time \u2014 he intended to secure his base of support, make the political contacts needed, and gain extensive experience. That America would enter the costly war in South Africa and the less costly, but still unpopular, war in Indonesia was unknown at this point, but it was only the tip of the iceberg of what would occur in that tumultuous decade. Barely a year and three months into his Governorship, the Presidency would be rocked as Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, and worse, his Vice President John Fitzgerald Kennedy would be assassinated just weeks later by a disgruntled Guyenese nationalist. JFK\u2019s death would put the Presidency in the hands of John McCormack, who had never had ambitions on the office and saw his role purely as one of salving the country\u2019s hurt and trying to bind the Republican-Democrats back together going into the Novembner elections of 1964. He failed dreadfully on both counts; his pardon of Nixon was widely derided, and JKF\u2019s brother Robert Francis Kennedy would defect to the NPP over Nixon\u2019s vetoing of the Civil Rights Act \u2014 RFK had been JFK\u2019s Chief of Staff and closest friend, and he was strongly motivated to see through his beloved brother\u2019s vision. The NPP had struggled to find the kind of charismatic leader they would need, and Bobby Kennedy was the perfect choice. The race was hard fought but RFK became President with over 360 EC votes, a healthy margin, and the political landscape was drastically shaken up.\n\nThough not nearly as shaken up as it would be a few years later. Bobby Kennedy\u2019s policies were inherited in part from his brother, and he had a core of rage that held the Nixon Administration responsible for Jack\u2019s death. This anger drove him to being a devoted progressive, spurred by the NPP-C wing of the party, and he enacted policy after policy to drive through a comprehensive Civil Rights Act in 1967, an act Glenn voiced support for and said \u201cIf I were in the Senate, I\u2019d be voting for this. Bobby Kennedy might be from a different party from me but he\u2019s a good man with some good ideas.\u201d And a few weeks later, RFK would meet the same fate as his brother, gunned down by a fanatic segregationist as he exited a hotel with his own Vice President, Hubert Humphrey.\n\nThe country was stunned. Just as sunlight had seemed to break through the clouds, and the Kennedy administration was working to fully implement his Civil Rights policies while also continuing some economic reforms, another President, another Kennedy, had been killed in America\u2019s streets. Not only that but the VP was dead too, leaving the succession to someone who was never on a Presidential ticket for the second time in four years. Strangely, the next in line declined the role, refusing to elaborate on his reasons, meaning it fell another rank to the South Georgia Senator Strom Thurmond. (It would not be until 1987 that the explanation for this and Thurmond\u2019s blackmail efforts would come to light \u2014 his already disgraced name falling even further, especially in an era of rapidly increasing acceptance of gay rights. It would also spark countless conspiracy theories that Thurmond had arranged the assassinations himself, though there has never been any corroborating evidence to that effect.)\n\nPresident Thurmond had one mission and one mission only - to roll back the Civil Rights Act and all associated policies. He would ensure that he restored and reinforced segregation, Jim Crow, and all the other racist policies that RFK had almost killed, and he had no care for what the cost to the law or Constitution might be. Though initially popular and viewed with cautious optimism for his tender eulogy of Bobby Kennedy and hints that he considered himself a caretaker president akin to McCormack, he moved rapidly behind the scenes to secure his power and enact every policy and pass every bill he could in pursuit of his goals. The Congress, shellshocked by the last few years, seemed to have given him a more-or-less free hand as he appealed to the need for leadership and to show a united American government to the people in order to restore faith. He was also completely unafraid to use Executive Orders in whatever capacity he thought he might benefit from. By the end of Thurmond\u2019s presidency barely a year after he took the office, the Constitutional order had been upturned. Maps were redistricted with offensive transparency. Those Thurmond considered politically opposed to him - minorities of all kinds as well as Republican and NPP-C voters - were disenfranchised to the best of his ability. Most infamously of all, and the policy which pushed America from protests to riots in all 49 states, he used an Executive Order to stack the Supreme Court with four additional Judges, all of them arch-conservatives who would reliably rule in favor of the segregationist, anti-black cause.\n\nAmidst all this, Glenn\u2019s opportunity had come early and he seized it with both hands. Painting himself as a moderate who disdained most political labels in favor of effective policies regardless of their origins, he was quickly adopted as the exact kind of all-American guy needed by the Republican-Democrats. He had been a competent and well-liked Governor that had pushed Ohio\u2019s quality of life up, poverty rates down, and enticed lucrative aerospace and other high-tech industries to the state. He was an American war hero, and an American hero generally, his name still carrying plenty of currency from the old feats in NASA. In short he ticked all the boxes \u2014 Existing fame, proven record (if shorter than some would like), mass appeal, visionary even as he was a level-headed straight talker. Exactly what the country needed, or so the RDs gambled.\n\nMeanwhile the NPP was riven between the Centrists and Far Right, the latter eventually claiming ascendancy as their ranks were filled by defecting Democrats who were now looking to the best place to secure what Thurmond had set in motion. Glenn would thus go up against the Far Right\u2019s Margaret Chase Smith. Much has been made about to what extent Smith\u2019s sex factored into her defeat, and certainly scholarship has demonstrated it played a role, but the scope of Glenn\u2019s victory on Election Day was tremendous and far more than could be accounted for by sexism alone. Winning over 400 EC votes, Glenn came into office with one of the strongest mandates in American history, and he wasted no time.\n\nThough restoring NASA had always been John Glenn\u2019s dearest purpose, and his earliest moves were centered around setting that institution back into motion, he had no shortage of other challenges and ideas to meet them. Indeed, while NASA busied itself with actually using its new influx of cash to rebuild, rehire or hire new staff, and overhaul its facilities, Glenn pursued something that made a far greater difference to the man and woman in the street, a project Glenn termed \u201cClosing the empathy deficit\u201d. Long argued about by American administrations and their Congresses, Glenn had seen how harmful the absence of a solid safety net was to Ohioans, and Ohio was one of the union\u2019s richer states at the time. \n\nThough in regular contact with NASA\u2019s director and personal friend James Webb, Glenn had no distractions on the legislative front. He pursued reform with a zeal, and within mere months had secured the passage of the most comprehensive reform to American benefits in history. Pensions were increased and protected, and poor Americans would still be able to claim pension sufficient for a dignified retirement even if they had not been able to pay in whilst younger. Medicare was a transformative healthcare coverage policy that provided coverage to all Americans over the age of 65 and all Americans with disabilities, and implemented controls on insurance companies outside of that to help insulate people from predation or excessive prices. The Americans with Disabilities Act (1969) was also implemented as part of this legislative fusillade, which Glenn insisted must include those who acquired disabilities during their lives as well as those who were disabled from birth, as some in Congress had argued against. Glenn\u2019s wife, Annie, had grown up with an extreme stutter that left her preferring to communicate without speaking, and the President\u2019s disability policy is widely acknowledged to have been at the least inspired by her, and perhaps to some extent guided by her advice and experiences.\n\nBy the summer of 1969, then, Glenn had already implemented large changes to America, and his popularity steadily rose. In Congress, he was usually disliked by the NPP-FR and struggled to attract votes from Democrats even though they were notionally a part of his party, but he had massive support from the Republicans and found a common cause with the NPP-C. The rising Social Democratic movement of America was represented by this wing of the NPP and were more than happy to support Glenn\u2019s reforms, even as many of them wished he\u2019d go further. Joyfully, the President was able to return his attentions to the institution he most loved, NASA. After months of work the institution was ready to go, and Glenn authorized the commencement of America\u2019s return to space with the Minerva Program. The unmanned Miverva I was prepared, launched, and American one again broke the bonds of Earth and had a presence in space. It was well understood that even going so far as to get a man back in orbit would be a serious undertaking and NASA would need, in essence, practice before it could attempt that. Minerva was only the first step in this long road, but it was one that boosted NASA\u2019s profile and popularity. Soon new missions were planned, and before long there seemed to be a launch almost daily. His duties precluded Glenn from viewing them all personally, but there was almost always a TV showing the latest launch in the White House.\n\nSatisfied with the ongoing progress Glenn turned back to Earthly concerns, this time looking at matters relating to nuclear power and weaponry. The destruction of Oahu had made Americans deeply leery of anything with the word \u201cnuclear\u201d in its name, but President Glenn had been convinced of the merits of nuclear power and worked hard to bring that word to the public. Here, he struggled, even after recruiting the Disney Corporation to produce educational propaganda \u2014 tedious in the extreme in the eyes of kids, but lauded by parents for being a balanced, unsensational, and honest look at the topic. He faced significant opposition from mining and power concerns, however, and though successful in the abstract, nuclear power never really took off under the Glenn presidency the way he had hoped. Militarily, he authorized a significant increase to America\u2019s stockpiles, expensive but hardly something that most would argue against, given the ongoing threats of the Nazi Reich and the Empire of Japan. That he had a greater plan in mind was known only to himself and a couple of closest aides.\n\nIt was at this point that almost everything was derailed. In the Middle East, decades of Italian rule and control came to a violent and sudden end as revolutions and civil wars ripped through the entire Arab world, and then beyond. Violence occurred in Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the Gulf States, Iraq, and Iran, all of it amid and exacerbating a tremendous spike in the prices of crude oil. The Oil Crisis had numerous causes and many dimensions, but the effect for John Glenn was that it put everything else on the back burner. None of his ambitions or plans mattered a whit if the country ground to a halt, and that\u2019s exactly what it was doing, as people couldn\u2019t fill their cars and industries couldn\u2019t keep the lights on. Emergency measures were implemented, including price controls, then rationing, massive investment in the Texan oil fields, and similarly massive investments into synthetic oil production. It was a chaotic period lasting months, but in time the situation stabilized and the domestic oil situation became a tolerable one. Belts were tightened countrywide, and smaller cars rapidly became the vogue for new buyers while existing plans for gas-guzzlers were scrapped by companies like Ford, but the worst of the crisis had been kept from America\u2019s shores.\n\nAnd then, Americans were back in space. Only in orbit at first under the Daedalus Program, but then the Diana Program aimed for the moon, taking up where the Apollo Project had been looking just before Nixon aborted it. Americans could not be first to the moon, but they could reach it, and that was almost as important. Regrettably, the first great tragedy struck the space program during this period - Diana II, intended to perform a lunar flyby and return to Earth, exploded in flight 194 seconds after liftoff. The three astronauts aboard died, and immediately the political and media classes pounced on Glenn. Support for NASA drained precipitously, and questions about why money and lives were being spent in this way were widespread. The President managed to divert the issue somewhat by lionizing the deceased, and when one of the widows spoke up in favor of continuing the project and how her husband would have wanted to carry on, the furor abated somewhat. NASA was now on notice, but it was not doomed.\n\nIf there were fears Diana II would hurt Glenn\u2019s re-election chances, they were swept away in a tidal wave of support for the man himself. A growing number of people supported the President primarily for his space program, referred to as the \u2018geeks\u2019, but the great majority regarded it more ambivalently. To some it was a positive thing but not the priority, whilst to others it was the President\u2019s pet project that could be tolerated as long as he didn\u2019t get lost in the clouds. But the first Glenn term had shown he had no such shortcomings. SSA, Medicare, and the ADA had transformed the lives of millions of Americans. He had not yet fully reckoned with the legacy of Thurmond, but things were certainly better for black Americans than they had been four years earlier, and Glenn was clearly no committed segregationist or racist - thus he carried the vote across the entire country, with the sole exception of California, who were strong supporters of the NPP and their hardline goal of reclaiming the Treaty Ports and revenging America against Japan. That was the sole state that went for Margaret Chase Smith, resulting in an EC vote of 494 for Glenn and 40 for Smith.\n\nJust months later Diana IV would vindicate the President, the space program, and NASA. Buzz Aldrin was not the first man on the moon, but he and Michael Collins were the first Americans, and when they planted the flag on February 13th 1973 it established that the United States was not only back in action, but a serious contender for space. It was smiles all round as the men returned to parades and dinners and events the likes of which American hadn\u2019t seen in decades, and John Glenn\u2019s boyish glee was visible to all. But it was a real achievement, one that seemed to restore a sense of confidence to the American people, and more people moved from simply letting the President have his toys to support, and more moved from casual support to strong, and more and more young people proudly proclaimed themselves geeks while speaking of internships at NASA, JPL, and the other centers of American aerospace.\n\nGlenn\u2019s second term saw a new wave of domestic legislation, for despite the continuing claims of opponents he had no desire to see things on the ground slide backwards. First he looked to ongoing problems in healthcare; whilst Medicare was largely working well and its initial problems had been ironed out, there were lingering difficulties. Foremost among these was in drug pricing. Seeking to gain ever more profits, Big Pharma had begun jacking up prices at an unsustainable rate, leaving more and more Americans unable to pay for their medication and taking bigger chunks out of Medicare into the bargain. John Glenn was incensed by this and it has been argued since that this was the real moment of his \u2018radicalization\u2019, which drove him from a reformist to someone more aligned with the NPP-C than his own party. As the pharma companies began funding anyone opposed to Glenn and the RDs, speaking out on the disastrous consequences they foresaw, and accused him of fascistic overreach, he deployed everything he had to crush Big Pharma\u2019s opposition, and when they began to fear he was winning and offered a compromise that would cover price controls on prescription medication but not others, he rejected it out of hand where once, it is believed, he would have taken the deal readily. Major price controls were introduced despite the howls of protest from big business. But Glenn was not done.\n\nNow that he had experienced first-hand the full fury of American business he had lost any love for them, and grown significantly more aligned with criticisms of business practice stemming from the left. In characteristic John Glenn fashion he did not rest after his victory, nor did he even take aim at a small target, but rather he went right for the jugular. He would destroy Right to Work. Right to Work was so named because it was claimed to give Americans the right to work without being forced to join a union to do so, as had been the case in several industries before such legislation was entered. In practice, it was a lynchpin of American business\u2019s strategy of crushing unions altogether, and keeping them weak and ineffective where they could not be eradicated. Glenn was no hardline Bukharinist, but the experiences with the drug price fight had convinced him that big business had too much power and the American worker had too little, and he sought to redress this.\n\nSurprisingly this passed with little trouble. Reeling from the previous fight with the President, big business seemed caught on the back foot, and he had huge popular support. In Congress he was able to count on the full support of the 18 NPP-Cs, one of the two NPP-FRs who was in the body at the time, and 43 of the 45 Republicans. Altogether, with some Democrats also convinced to come over, the vote passed by 68-30, and Right to Work was dead. His subsequent efforts on Social Security were even more intense and more dramatically successful, and there was a massive \u201cGlennite\u201d or \u201cGlennist\u201d tide across the country where, quite aside from questions of nuclear power or space exploration, the President\u2019s domestic proposals found huge support and popularity. Social Security was a tremendous undertaken that far outmatched the scope of his first term reforms, though it was informed by them and incorporated them into a larger structure. Unemployment benefits would rise, healthcare coverage would continue to expand (The first \u2018public option\u2019 arose here, with a special insurance provider available to any employee of the Federal Government), and most dramatically, the introduction of a six-hour workday. This last reinvigorated the strength of big business, who threatened opposition and promised doom, but Glenn was never a man to do things by halves and his will was unbreakable, and he had experienced those howls before only to find them impotent in the face of public support. Though initially a step too far for some in his own party, the President appealed directly to the public to write to their Congresspersons and Senators in support of the policy, and the Glennite tide became one of mail that inundated the country\u2019s leadership, convincing them that it was not going to be electoral suicide to support it.\n\nLess noticed, and more of interest to the accountants and lawyers of the country, were efforts to rationalize and better codify the tax system. Though few actual tax rises took place (hence the lack of public interest), the closing of loopholes, simplification of the code, and increasing the ability of Americans to either easily do their own taxes or to allow the government to do it for them helped bring in greater revenues. More importantly was the general state of the economy - after years of work and investment, and a whole host of new measures to help the poorest Americans, the introduction of Social Security was followed just months later by a glowing report on the state of American poverty. Where the poverty rate had peaked as high as 45%, and was in the high 30s when Glenn first took office, it had now dropped to below 25%, a milestone that widely reassured the public of Glenn\u2019s projects and plans while taking the legs out from criticisms of how much was being spent. After all, a richer society means a higher tax take, but you have to invest to get to that society - so the argument went, and so America in the 1970s seemed to prove. Even those who remained in poverty were seeing increases in their quality of life, and abject penury had been cut significantly even where it had not been replaced by affluence.\n\nMeanwhile, the frontier of space was looking to its greatest challenge yet, and NASA had spent its time marshalling resources, conducting the needed research, and experimenting with any number of plans and components and mission profiles. Dianas V and VI had taken Americans to the moon and conducted vital experiments, but Glenn, James Webb, NASA as a whole, and now most of the country, wanted to see America not just take second place or catch up with the Nazis, but to fling themselves into first place. The German Reich had emerged from their bloody Civil War almost a decade ago but the orthodox Fuhrer Bormann had no seeming interest in returning to space, and the collapse of the Reich into the German Civil War of 1963-65 had done major harm to their economic and industrial base, meaning it would have been domestically unpopular to spend money on a race deemed long since won rather than on the ongoing project of rebuilding cities from Hamburg to Munich. Thus, without any real rivals at the time, NASA turned their eyes to the great prize, Mars. The Ares Project began.\n\nStill proceeding at a breakneck pace, Ares was intended to get a human to Mars in just four missions. This has since come in for much criticism, and labeled as a desire to get it done while Glenn was still in office rather than to do it with maximum safety. In the event, however, NASA was either competent enough, lucky enough, or both, to avoid any major disasters like Diana II in the Ares Project. The four missions were to proceed as follows;\n\nAres I - An unmanned probe designed to both test mission parameters and part performance, whilst also taking the best possible orbital pictures of Mars to examine potential landing sites.\nAres II - An unmanned probe which would attempt a landing near a selected landing site, equipped with a rover for scientific work.\nAres III - An unmanned package which contained the bulk of materials and supplies needed to establish Hellas I, the prospective Mars base where the astronauts would dwell and work during their time there (The realities of orbital mechanics meant it was far less efficient to try and return immediately than to remain on Mars for a time and return at a later point where planetary alignments were better)\nAres IV - The lander unit, return rocket, and the three astronauts would be aboard.\n\nEvery mission went perfectly. Every step seemed to fall into place. NASA had attracted the best and brightest by this point, and it paid them well, but they were motivated by more than financial reward now and devoted themselves utterly to the task. Even so, James Webb later said \u201cI don\u2019t want to downplay the extraordinary efforts that everyone at NASA made to achieve this incomparable milestone, but it did feel at times that we were proceeding with the blessing of our great almighty God.\u201d Whether by grace or effort or pure luck, the Ares missions succeeded and even as Glenn was embroiled in scandal back home, the stars continued to inch closer.\n\nThat scandal was Glenn\u2019s major defeat that stemmed from his efforts to nationalize the entire country\u2019s uranium mines. His longtime nuclear weapons plan had been proceeding somewhat in the background, seen as simply an unpleasant reality that had to be done by most of the public, who would rather not think about such things when life elsewhere was continuing to improve. The project, even after purchasing Canadian, Australian, and South African uranium in bulk, was facing ongoing shortages of the material. Glenn was pushing for increased production from domestic mines, and seemed to be succeeding, until he got the bill. Rates were double the existing costs, and the mining concerns were quite happy to demand this price from the government under the guise of needing to undertake expansions in pursuit of Glenn\u2019s production demands. Had the price hike been more reasonable, or had the mining concerns come to Glenn to explain and negotiate on such lines, it seems certain the President would have acquiesced. To be slapped with what something so extortionate without warning, however, provoked his ire. Normally a man with a strong handle on his emotions, aides would later describe Glenn as \u201cstormy\u201d and \u201cvoluminous\u201d over the matter.\n\nBy now used to bold moves and cutting Gordian knots, Glenn believed he saw an obvious, if drastic solution. The nation\u2019s defense hinged on the nuclear stockpile. The nuclear stockpile hinged on the production of uranium. Ergo, the production of uranium was a matter of national defense, and the President had the authority to nationalize the industry if it was required for that end. The uproar was immediate and massive, but Glenn persisted, and when no offer at compromise was forthcoming he pushed through with the policy. The mining bosses had a powerful route that other big businesses who had faced Glenn\u2019s policies lacked, however, in the form of legal argument. Given the seriousness of the matter and the importance of national defense it rushed through the courts with incredible speed, before finding itself before the Supreme Court, a place still filled with the packed Judges of Strom Thurmond.\n\nIt was not known beforehand which way they would break. On the one hand they were seen as steadfast allies of the NPP, meaning overwhelmingly concerned with matters of defense - but on the other, they were seen as friends of big business as well as leery of the President\u2019s progressive bent. In the end, the 8-5 ruling went for the mining companies thanks to arguments that, as there was no ongoing conflict that directly involved the USA, the President\u2019s attempts to invoke the country\u2019s security could not apply.\n\nBefore the day was out, a new offer had landed on the President\u2019s desk, not double but triple the original prices.\n\nIt was a massive defeat for the President and one which shook him deeply. He had been America\u2019s golden boy until that moment, a unifier, a man of vision and drive, a man who was trying his best to make life better for ordinary people. He now learned that his ambitions could be checked, and that said roadblocks could be insurmountable. But John Glenn was no Strom Thurmond. Despite his anger, he accepted the ruling and paid the mining companies, and if he was to exact a revenge it would be both done legally and done for the good of the country, not to settle a personal grudge.\n\nThis drama was not the best base from which to break with centuries of American tradition and announce his bid for a third term as President, but that is just what President Glenn did to party leaders in early 1976 as they were discussing who would attempt to succeed him to the White House. This caused more hubbub and dissent, but there was never any law against it, and Glenn argued that in the absence of any obvious candidate who could succeed him they may as well stick with the man who was still polling pretty well. The Democrats were incensed by this and driven still further from the Republicans, but the Republican segment of the RDs agreed with his suggestion, on condition that he renounce any possibility of pursuing a fourth term.\n\nThe political and media elites had a similar reaction, ranging from outrage to mere grumbling that Glenn would dare attempt something George Washington had made verboten at the country\u2019s founding. But there was still no law against it, and the administration argued that John Glenn came into office with a number of promises, promises he was keeping, but which required one more term to see through to fruition. The NPP opposition decried this as a dangerous overreach, whilst those less opposed to Glenn himself voiced worries that it set an ill precedent and questioned the man\u2019s humility. The NPP would this time abandon the Far Right after two consecutive losses to Glenn, and instead put forward Michael Harrington, who had unsuccessfully pursued their nomination in 1968. This made for an unusually civil and friendly Presidential campaign \u2014  Glenn did not go so far as Harrington wanted on most issues, but by this point there was no great gulf ideologically between Glennite Republicanism and the Social Democrats of the NPP-C. After their first debate the viewing figures tanked as the men got dragged into details on broader topics they more or less agreed on, and neither seemed inclined to attempt any serious attacks on the others, though Harrington did try to needle the President over his pursuit of a third term somewhat. Only in foreign affairs did they different significantly, with Harrington making some gains by proposing a nuclear drawdown while pressing Japan conventionally over the Treaty Ports while Glenn maintained his hardline pro-nuclear stance.\n\nThe consequence of this was not just a calm election, but one with much lower turnout than any election for decades by percentage. The more radical right stayed home as they saw no candidate for them, as did the harder edge of the Democrats, while the apparently lower stakes than usual meant an awful lot of people decided to enjoy election day with other matters. For the first time Glenn did not achieve a total blowout victory, winning 345 EC votes, but this still gave him a strong mandate to finish his work.\n\nGlenn\u2019s third term would be his most dramatic, and most tense, and would culminate in what has since been argued to be the greatest diplomatic achievement of any American President even as he oversaw America\u2019s greatest scientific achievement. His first task, he decided, was to finish the work of building up American nuclear stocks. He now had an endgame in sight, and was gradually bringing more people into the high-stakes game he intended to play as he moved the pieces into place. A secretive incursion into the remnants of Nazi Africa secured a major uranium mine that helped bolster American production, and it soon became obvious that the US nuclear triad was no longer merely overwhelming, but had become outright apocalyptic. Even if no other powers fired back, the American stockpile alone would be sufficient to end human life on Earth, and most other forms as well. So armed, Glenn began to put out feelers and turned his attention to domestic matters while the diplomats began their work.\n\nDomestically, the legacy of Thurmond had faded over the eight years of Glenn\u2019s presidency. Tactics such as redistricting must be updated as populations move around, and a great many legal challenges had succeeded in weakening all of Thurmond\u2019s projects at local and state levels. His tangle with the Supreme Court had brought the whole affair directly into Glenn\u2019s sights, and he resolved that when he left Washington four years hence, he would leave behind a transparent, honest, and scrupulously clean capital. He had never been a corrupt man himself, and having brought in a fresh staff for almost every role in the White House in 1969 had helped sweep some of the corruption out by itself, but there was still work to do. Investigations were begun, houses were cleaned, and the Senate Ethics Committee was refreshed and newly empowered. A long-term project to review constitutional matters with a goal to preventing excesses like President Thurmond\u2019s or corruption like Nixon\u2019s was established. And in his last major effort against corruption, Glenn banned outright the practice of lobbying, a move which massively diminished the power of corporations or similar actors to unduly influence elected officials where the common American could not. America, finally, emerged from most of the shadows cast by the 1960s and entered a new era of clean and honest politics, one where districts would be drawn to maximize democratic representation rather than suppress it and where the size of the purse had much less influence on the size of the voice.\n\nThe Supreme Court provided a major stumbling block, however, and Glenn and his administration were able to navigate a satisfactory course through that particular issue. If it was allowed to stand, what was to prevent a future President from stacking the court further, even to farcical levels? But there was no apparent way to reduce the size of the Court as it stood, not when doing so would involve the removal of sitting Justices. This was a matter left to a future administration, in the end.\n\n(Continued in comments) BLESSED GLENN\nBLESSED GLENN\nBLESSED GLENN",

[This article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/near-death-experiences-ar_b_5565488) mentions a woman who nearly died and during her NDE saw an old shoe on the roof of the hospital.\n\nIgnore the religious and \"entering the afterlife\" aspects of NDEs; focus only on the fact that people have NDEs which provide them with information for which they have no other possible source.  That should be enough to validate the claim \"we are not merely our bodies\". I'm not completely forgetting about those, just in another comment i have proposed a sort of device to test them. To my knowledge, no such research have been done, some do claims to have veridical NDEs but the evidence is lacking. Because memory is kinda unreliable ([https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/how-many-of-your-memories-are-fake/281558/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/how-many-of-your-memories-are-fake/281558/))  and because of the power of suggestibility, we really need strong, rigorous testing of such extraordinary claims, and the evidence i've examined i found lacking.\n\nFor instance, if many NDEs patients make specific claims, and nobody is recording how many of them turn out false, that's not a very rigorous way to test for their veracity, by mere probability one of them will end up turning true, the same way that someone spouting conspiracy theories all day for instance will often land a real one - for the movies buffs here, there is this thriller movie about exactly that happening to a taxi driver [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118883/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118883/) \\- you also have to account for the shoe on the roof not being spotted before going to the hospital, or before the operation.\n\nA device like i've proposed will solve most of those problems.",

            "text": "The immigration platform is rooted in racism. No it isn\u2019t. Here is the policy for Indigenous Issues:\n\n**ISSUE**\n\nThe indigenous population of Canada is extremely diversified. It accounts for about 5% of Canada\u2019s population and comprises First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis. There are more than 600 First Nations communities dispersed across the country. More than half of First Nations Canadians don\u2019t live on reserves.\n\nIndigenous issues are also very complex. Some communities are prosperous, others much poorer than the Canadian average. Many suffer from critical social issues, including homelessness, crime, domestic violence, substance abuse and suicide. Many don\u2019t have the basic services that we take for granted such as access to clean water. There are other major issues to address regarding treaty negotiations, housing, property rights on reserves, residential schools, etc.\n\nIt is not possible to address more than a few of these issues in the context of this election platform. Here is what a People\u2019s Party government would prioritize on the basis of its four key principles.\n\n**RESPECT**\n\nMany injustices were committed in the past by the Canadian government towards indigenous peoples, some of which are still ongoing. We cannot rewrite the past, but only seek the best way to live together harmoniously in the future. This relationship must be based on mutual respect and a balanced approach taking into account the needs of the indigenous population and the interests of the Canadian population as a whole.\n\n- A People\u2019s Party government is committed to seeking options to replace the paternalistic Indian Act, which keeps indigenous peoples in a state of dependency and allows the federal government to control most aspects of their lives, with a new legal framework that guarantees equal rights and responsibilities to indigenous people as Canadians, and promotes the self-reliance of communities.\n\n- A People\u2019s Party government will respect our Constitution and treaties. It will reaffirm the federal government\u2019s power to approve natural resources and infrastructure projects, after adequate consultations with affected indigenous groups, and in partnership with them to ensure they can benefit from these economic opportunities.\n\n**FREEDOM**\n\nThe lack of real private property on reserves is in part responsible for the poor state of housing and the social ills that derive from it, and is one of the greatest impediments to economic development.\n\n- A People\u2019s Party government will explore further avenues to promote the establishment of individual property rights on reserves so as to empower its residents, and give them increased control over their lives.\n\n**FAIRNESS**\n\nFairness demands that all Canadians benefit from roughly equivalent services wherever they live. It\u2019s unacceptable that some indigenous communities live in conditions that resemble those of third world countries. But the current model to solve these problems is based on top-down bureaucratic solutions imposed by Ottawa on dependent communities with no voice in the process.\n\n- A People\u2019s Party government will ensure that indigenous communities take more ownership of the services they receive in partnership with Ottawa and other levels of government.\n\n**RESPONSIBILITY**\n\nAlthough Ottawa spends about $24 billion a year on indigenous programs, there is little evidence that living conditions have been improving in indigenous communities. The federal government and indigenous administrations have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayers\u2019 money is well spent.\n\n- A People\u2019s Party government will review federal spending to ensure that programs are better targeted to benefit the indigenous population, in particular the communities that have the greatest needs.",

I'd love to hear how we might detect ether of these, but other plausible FTL contenders are welcome too.\n\nI'll start:\n\nOn the Alcubierre warp drive front, I think we would see specific patterns in fast radio bursts. As I understand the theory (and someone will no doubt correct me if I'm far wrong) particles that get caught up in the warp bubble along the path of travel will get released all at once. This will release an energetic burst of particles the direction of travel of the vessel as it exits warp at its destination. The longer you're in FTL the more of a hazard these particles are likely to become.\n\nI expect the majority of FRB's are naturally occurring. But, among a subset of fast radio bursts represent Alcubierre warp travel, I would expect to see the following qualities.\n\n1. Repeatable along a rough timeline but not an exact one. This assumes travel along predefined routes that are effectively trade networks.\n2. Frequent bursts, as craft travel in hops, to prevent the buildup of excessive amounts of particles in their warp bubble over time. This assumes fast moving high energy particles are effectively ecological hazard to anything that happens to be in the way.\n3. Many bursts that, even when observed in detail, lack a high probability point of origin that can be explained as a natural phenomena.\n4. Obviously, this would be burred within a larger data-set of completely normal FRB's with explainable causes.\n5. If FRB's are an ecological hazard (at close range anyway) we would probably expect to see waste energy from various forms of subluminal travel, too, such as the laser highways Isaac seems so fond of. In effect Alcubierre would get you to the right neighborhood and a laser highway (or some other method) would get you to the right house.\n\nOn the traversable artificial wormholes front, I have no idea if the light distortions would differ compared to ordinary gravitational lensing. Someone with a strong math and physics background can probably say one way or another. I cannot.\n\nAssuming for the moment the light distortions would not differ, the only way I could see us discerning a wormhole from other phenomena would be if its mass is lower than a naturally occurring object with the same lensing effects. That's quite an assumption and I have no idea if it would be true in practice. I kind of doubt it. But if it is, the juxtaposition of lower non-lensing gravitational effects with higher lensing effects and no high mass intervening objects to explain it would suggest a low mass wormhole.\n\nAre any of my leaps of logic here especially flawed? Are there any other technosignatures we would expect to see from these *or any other* plausible form of FTL? I'm under a striking impression that you overestimate the strength of those effects. You'll hear the radio chatter of the spaceships long before noticing the lensing effect of their wormholes. Honestly, you could probably read the markings on those ships before noticing the lensing.",

Downside is that it\u2019s very confusing in the beginning. Neal Stephenson is another pioneer of the genre\u2026 If you want an easy read go for Altered Carbon series and Ready Player One (and Two). Stay away from Bladerunner (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) as it can be a bit difficult to get into, but it is also a great book.

MANY. MORE. \n\nit is very rare to have a conversation with her where she will not bring up q. for my birthday last year, all i asked her was to not talk about qanon. we had not even pulled out of my dad's driveway before she started talking about it. i told her to stop, and she yelled at me saying that she wouldn't stop because it was important. i got out and went back inside of my dad's house. she sobbed to facebook about how much of a terrible bully i am. speaking of facebook, all she posts about is q. roughly 5 posts a day at minimum. all q. a family member's birthday? q post- hell. try to take over the party and make it maga themed. national holiday? q post. any day of the god damn week? Q POST. \n\nshe does not have a job. she does not do house work or cook except on occasion. she lives off of our grandparents + my dad's child support checks, and has a maid that comes every week. all day every day, from as soon as she gets up to when she finally goes to sleep, she's watching conspiracy videos. when she rarely leaves her room, she's always watching her phone with the video's volume all the way up so she doesn't risk missing anything. one time she could not afford to get us lunch/dinner because she had spent $50 on an early access conspiracy video. nothing but videos. efforts to distract her by my little siblings result in yelling and her locking herself in her room. when she does leave the house, it's usually to hang out with her brother, who is also very deep into q. they talk for hours about it and nothing else. \n\nshe preys on my mental illness. she is my mother. she knows how i act when a panic attack is coming on. i have pretty obvious symptoms (tics) that are very hard to hide from her. if she sees this, she will use it to tell me how the world is going to end, how all my friends will die, how everything i love is satanic and wrong, but how i can still be saved if i just turn to jesus and live in extreme paranoia. as you can probably guess, this makes it extremely difficult for me to keep my anxiety under control. my main coping mechanism for my anxiety has always been horror movies, particularly slashers or earth-invasion/apocalypse- type movies. as you can probably guess, the ladder has been absolutely ruined for me. i went to see a quiet place 2, a movie i was very excited about, only to be met with crippling fear when the genre used to give me comfort because \"oh it's just fake! this will never happen!\". she has tricked my brain into seeing outlandish movie scenarios and believing that it WILL happen, and so it no longer brings comfort, only fear and dread. i cried for hours when i got home. horror movies mean a lot to me and now a big chunk of the ones i enjoyed cause me to break down. she does this kind of behavior to my younger sister, too, causing her to cry in fear and then offering no comfort because \"it's the truth\". \n\npeople always laugh or don't believe me when i tell them about the shit she does. i dont care when friends dont believe me, because they eventually hear it for themselves (usually bc i'll be on the phone with them and they'll overhear. i cant risk bringing my friends to her house as most of them are minorities.) and then apologize. \n\nshe has a huuge martyr complex and it's scary. she wants to kill and die for her god. i overhear her talking about it all the time. \"we christians are being attacked.\" \"this is war.\", \"i'll kill for jesus.\", \"we are in spiritual warfare.\", \"we are in danger\". \"i bought another AR this week\", \"i can't wait to die for jesus\". a black teenager stole a case of water bottles out of her car, and the next day she posted on facebook bragging about how she wouldve liked to catch him and shoot him. it is genuinely scary how far gone she is. she genuinely thinks that as a white christian middle class american, she is the most oppressed and in danger out of everyone. \n\nshe also.. has very low intelligence i've found. she tried to tell me dinosaurs mustve been a lie because scientists say theyre from millions of years ago but that the earth has only existed for 2019 years. a few weeks ago she called me panicked saying that she could see the moon in the day time. she also couldnt wrap her head around why the moon \"disappeared\" a few nights a month despite there not being clouds. after a long conversation, i found out that she thought the moon produced it's own light, and that it completely disappeared in the day time. there have been multiple instances where she's screamed bloody murder and yelled for us to get outside, only for her to point at a jet (we live under a flight path) and say that it's an alien or something. one of those times she was screaming that it \"changed directions\" and must be a hologram, only for us to point out that there were two different jets, one going in each direction, and that she just looked at the wrong one. she claimed that phones were made with demonic magic because she couldn't understand how they work. ever since q, she can never be wrong. its always science that's wrong. she's grown a lot more confident in her stupidity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni dont even know what to do. she's causing so much pain to those close to her, while surrounding herself with other q folks so she can indulge in her fantasies. her addiction, her cult, makes me so upset. im most worried about my little sister, who was taught slurs by my mother, as well as most of the q ideology. what do ya know, the second she was angry at her best friend (a black girl) she called her the n word. my mom is adamant she did nothing wrong, and that the little girl's mom is just sensitive. my little sister claims to know my mother is crazy, but clearly has internalized misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, racism, etc etc from the comments she makes when she's with me. i try to calmly correct her when she says something bigoted, but then she gets defensive- just like my mom does. i'm at a loss and don't have much control. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for listening to me vent i guess. i hate qanon with such a burning passion. feel free to ask questions and stuff. there's a lot more here that i just wont go into unless asked about, otherwise the post would become massive. any ideas on how to cope with this better are greatly appreciated. q is ruining people. fuckkkkk.

Our finances are at vastly different stages - I have a higher income, savings, and no debt, and he recently started to make money with a lot of student debt and loans that still need to be paid off (it will be a while to pay his off). He also just leased a luxury car and bought a pre-con condo.. so needless to say he is loaded with payments. He\u2019s a bit more impulsive in spending than I am. I worked really hard to be debt free and wanted to make a wise decision before making a large purchase of any nature. I was wondering if it is wise for me to buy a house on my own before marriage and having him live with me after marriage? Are there any caveats / negatives I should be aware of for this? My friends have been telling me about the marital law (that it will become his house in equal share once we get married - and if we get divorced he is entitled to half). Not sure if that\u2019s something that even matters or not. Any advice would be appreciated here! Ugh\n\nYou two should buy a house together and split if.  Car leases are huge red flags - it\u2019s a long term rental.  \n\nAnd yes, your house would most likely be one community property- and depending on the state, his car lease and condo would become your community property",

Im also in online school but ONLY for this semester (so im in person in january). So these few months are basically just the most unimportant months of my highschool experience and im taking advantage of them so i dont need to worry about getting my hours later.\n\nThe elections are happening in canada, and i know the candidate for my town personally so im volunteering for her. I dont have a formed political opinion, im 14! i know the party isnt TERRIBLE but alot of people dislike it. all ive been doing the past few days is knocking on doors, going through my script of asking if they've voted, giving them the poll times, and handing them fliers. \n\nI didnt think it would be this bad honestly but ive been catcalled, yelled at, plain out disrespected and been rude to. Someone told me i was \"too pretty for this neighbourhood\", \"a young sheep\", and a couple of boys who barely looked 9 told me my skin looks like shit (im brown skinned). I can deal with that but today, my team leader dropped me and my friend off in a neighbourhood and a man mowing his lawn yelled at us \"your supporting segregation!\" \"your the youth. you should know better\" \"supporting (not nice word!!!). disgusting\". i was going to snap back, but my friend told me to drop it (we were told not to respond to things like this &amp; record them). \n\nWhen i got home, i ranted to my sister and she told me it was mostly my fault. She said people had the right to voice their opinions and me walking out dressed in that partys shirt and handing out fliers was inviting them to voice their opinion and it was what i signed up for, and honestly just annoying. I get where shes coming from but i think theres better ways for this man to voice his opinion instead of heckling some 14 year old girls.\n\n  \nAITA for choosing to volunteer someplace that might get me into conflict?

I love the Donda skits/samples, they really tie the album together neatly, I wish they bookended it as well though.\n\nThe album is very inconsistent, and reminds me of the first version/my first listen of TLOP. As such, I could also see this growing on me over time. Sonically, it reminds me of a ton of Kanye's past works: the religion of JiK, the personal themes of Ye, the spiritualism and thematic cohesion of TLOP, the slow, sadness of 808s (the autotune also elicits this at times), even the otherworldly sound of KSG. Of course, the WTT references are obvious as well. Maaaan... not getting Life Of The Party really hurts, especially after that Tyler snippet",

            "text": "Lastly, answering your question about God vs. Satan\u2026 Satan is most definitely in the Bible, there are numerous verses about him. \n\nOne of the mysteries of the Christian life is why God didn\u2019t destroy Satan immediately after Satan sinned. We know that God will one day defeat Satan by throwing him into the Lake of Fire where he will be tortured day and night forever (Revelation 20:10), but it\u2019s valid to wonder why God has not destroyed Satan already. Perhaps we will never know God\u2019s exact reasoning, but we do know certain things about His nature.\n\nFirst, we know God is absolutely sovereign over all creation, and this includes Satan. Certainly, Satan and his demons wreak havoc in the world, but they are only allowed a certain amount of freedom. We also know that God has planned everything from the beginning of time to the end. Nothing can thwart His plans, and things are proceeding exactly on schedule. \u201cThe LORD of hosts has sworn: \u2018As I have planned, so shall it be, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand\u2019\u201d (Isaiah 14:24).\n\nSecond, \u201cwe know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose\u201d (Romans 8:28). Whatever God has planned for Satan, that plan will be the best one possible. God\u2019s perfect wrath and justice will be satisfied, and His perfect righteousness will be glorified. Those who love Him and who wait for His plan to be fulfilled will be thrilled to be part of that plan and will praise and glorify Him as they see it unfold.\n\nThird, we know that to question God\u2019s plan and its timing is to question God Himself, His judgment, His character and His very nature. It is not wise to question His right to do exactly as He pleases. The psalmist tells us, \u201cAs for God, His way is perfect\u201d (Psalm 18:30). Whatever plan comes from the mind of the Almighty is the best plan possible. It is true that we can\u2019t expect to understand that mind perfectly, as He reminds us, \u201c\u2018For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,\u2019 says the LORD. \u2018For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts\u2019\u201d (Isaiah 55:8-9). Nevertheless, as believers our responsibility to God is to obey Him, to trust Him, and to submit to His will, whether we understand it or not. In the case of His timing for Satan\u2019s demise, it has to be the best possible plan because it is God\u2019s plan. I'm not claiming whether there is a god or not, I just wondered how you know. I'm an agnostic, I don't claim to know anything about a creator. You claim the biblical god is the one real god because the bible says so. Great. The bible has no authority to me because it didn't prove it's authority. As long as YHWH behaves exactly like Allah, Ganesha, Krishna or Zeus, like he doesn't exist, his book means nothing to me regarding god's existence.\n\nYou say \"First, *we know* God is absolutely sovereign over all creation \\[...\\]\". We know nothing actually since nobody cares what your book says. All that ramble is useless for me. Prove to me that god exists without referring to an ancient book that had a very questionable formation history. \n\nThat's why I don't want to further argue about Satan, but here's a presentation about the [evolution of satan](https://youtu.be/FU8NRNNSBJw) in the bible.\n\nThe theory of reincarnation makes more sense to me actually, why don't you look into that too? If god want's me to believe in him, he'll find a way, he's god. So far he didn't want to contact me, and I already did my part.",

            "text": "I'm currently working my first job 2 years out of college - it's relatively low paying, but I had what I ***thought*** was a good medical plan.  On 6/30 I went to Cedars Sinai ER in Los Angeles after getting two days of back to back migraines, my first migraines ever.  I was scared and the Urgent Care I went to that morning said I needed an MRI to know what was going on, and that I needed to go that day since two days in a row of migraines with no prior history could mean something serious.\n\nI get the bill from Cedars Sinai a few days ago, and it's almost $3,200.  I'd been told that I had a $1,200 deductible and a $250 ER copay.  What I hadn't been told was that I also had a 20% coinsurance cost on the Maximum Allowed cost for each ER procedure, and a Maximum Yearly Coinsurance/Copayment of $7,800.  So I got charged 20% of 6 different procedures, which included an MRI and CT Scan.  My coinsurance cost is 150% of my deductible!\n\nI can't afford $3,200.  I moved cross country for this job, so for the past two years I've been paying for an apartment in LA, had to buy my first car, etc.  Thank god student loans have been deferred til next year.  I have no safety net - I can't move home or I'll lose my job, and this charge is going to wipe out my savings.  I'm planning on contacting the hospital billing department tomorrow about getting an easement on the bill, or at least being able to go on some kind of payment plan, but I'm seriously scared.\n\nDoes anyone know of any resources that could help me?  My manager at work is aware of what's going on since he saw me freaking out after I'd called my insurance provider to make sure all the numbers on the Explanation of Benefits were correct.  I can't go to my parents for help covering the cost, it's just not an option, and I don't have any other family out in LA save for a younger cousin who is ever worse off financially than I am.  I really don't know what to do here besides begging the hospital to help me. It appears Cedars Sinai has a pretty generous charity care program, if you make less than 50k or so I would definitely apply. We just got my son's ER bill wiped through charity care and it was a huge burden lifted.",

Hopefully, I'd like to attend a top program to make sure my degree is maximally worth the additional student debt I'd be taking on.\n\nDo they just volunteer in a public health organization throughout medical school or pursue public health research during medical school and that's enough for admission to Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Columbia etc. to fulfill the public health experience requirement for an MPH? Or are the requirements I mentioned above only relevant for DrPH and PhD programs instead of MPH? It seems conflicting since while I hear that admission to top MPH programs is relatively doable at around 30-50%, it also seems to require a ton of additional experiences etc. which seem unreasonable for a medical student to obtain in addition to all the other responsibilities of medical school.\n\nI am currently applying to medical school and I'm also very interested in pursuing public health in the future. I want to get a general idea what kind of experiences/application the average matriculant at top MPH programs applies with so that I can plan out my extracurriculars for the next few years accordingly. I did my MPH prior to starting medical school but I think a lot of students who are interested in that apply specifically to MD/MPH programs.

What allows private healthcare to not do exactly that? These people are just fixed in the idea of \"government=bad\". What's the difference from that to private healthcare refusing service (\"saying no\")? If someone has bad intentions, they will do that no matter what.  However, private healthcare has the profit motive, so this happening is way more probable. In reality, this literally happens all the time in non-socialised healthcare systems just because someone doesn't have enough money/ insurance to pay for their treatment. There are soooooo many cases of people dying or having to live their whole lives with permanent injuries/ diseases because of that. I haven't heard of any cases of people dying because socialised healthcare providers refused to take care of them, that is really just a boogeyman that person invented.\n\nThe person you were arguing with may say \"well in that case the victim/ victim's family can always process the hospital\". But no. Firstly, if they didn't have money to pay for healthcare, they'll hardly have money to pay a lawyer. Even if they manage, private hospitals have a lot of monetary power and will be able to have teams of very expensive lawyers. \nSecondly, the law protects private property/ private businesses. In most cases, healthcare companies win because well, they function just like another private company. Their logic will go like: the client (patient) pays and gets a service in return (healthcare). If the client (patient) didn't pay, they aren't entitled to receive anything in return. For-profit hospitals aren't interested to save lives. Only to secure profits. They don't care if people die or get hurt.\n\n\n\nI won't go deep about socialised healthcare because you seem to know its benefits. But basically, it doesn't have a profit motive. Their motive is just to provide healthcare. Just like you said, this benefits the whole population.",

            "text": "Today I wanted to discuss a topic to see if any of you teachers were aware. It may have even had an effect on you.\n\nI am an \u201cintrovert\u201d and I wanted to share how much it negatively affected me in life and school(which is a part of life).\n\nBecause the US has a society that is biased towards extroverts, I was constantly modeling myself after them. But this took so much of my energy as a child that it prevented me from doing as well in school as I could have. If you thinking speaking should be filled with witty quips you will just end up not talking or participating. If you are used to people bullying you because you are quiet you will suffer socially and mentally check out. If you think you should be someone else and act fake all day, people will bully you. If you act fake all day you lose your energy to be you. If you aren\u2019t being you, you no longer recognize that you have a choice, that you can lift up your head and open your eyes and choose your own friends. (I always waited for someone to pick me as a friend. Guess who would always pick me? Ding Ding Ding! Abusive people. I\u2019m the kid who taught other kids and gave them home work answers just so they would treat me well. Thanks a lot No Child Left Behind.)\n\nIt took me until now (I am 26.) to realize \u201cOh shit, not only was I bullied as a kid, but I am still being bullied now by full grown adults.\u201d It was hard for me to realize because I wasn\u2019t being wedgied or thrown in trash cans like you see on tv, but I was suffering from relational aggression. \n\nI think teachers should re-evaluate how they ask for participation so as not to shame a shy kid going through this. Kids will want to participate if the lessons are touching their lives in a respectful and non-intrusive way.\n\nHowever, there is a difficulty. It took a bunch of hard knocks in life for me to seek out the information about introversion on my own and absorb it in a real way. So walking up to a shy kid and trying to \u201cfix\u201d them probably won\u2019t work. I think the best strategy is giving them space and defending them in a non embarrassing way (because being teacher\u2019s pet doesn\u2019t help either.) \n\nAlso \u201cintroversion\u201d is not really a concrete identity and it can become a limiting identity. It\u2019s hard to tell if you are behind because you are introverted or introverted because you are behind. But either way, people should not be pressured to act in a way that is contrary to what they truly feel like doing. (This is not an excuse to stop working because it is not what you feel like doing.) \n\nI would also like to add some other factors about my identity that did not help when combined with my \u201cintroversion\u201d (I put quotes around introversion because it is just a stand in for what society deems as a shy personality.)\n\nInfo on me: Mixed Race, Child of an Immigrant, Female, Working Class, Abuse in the Home. (Not many knew because I kept to myself and got numerous awards and A\u2019s, education was my out. This is why introversion is a whole chicken egg thing to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nInterested to hear your guy\u2019s thoughts.\n\nHere is an article that expands on the topic: https://link.medium.com/Iv1npPV1jcb\n\nSome of you may think you are at peace with your introversion. I would ask you to question that and really dig deep into your emotions to really think if you are at peace. And think about all the kids you could help. I am introverted as well.

Some jobs pay more than others. Someone who studies a career involving STEM is in a lot better position to pay off their college debt than someone who goes to school for something like childcare or gender studies. The vast majority of people who are complaining about college debt are oftentimes choosing careers that are not in high demand or don't offer much in terms of income mobility. These same people are then begging the government to force the people who chose good careers to pay for their college debt which is incredibly unfair in my opinion. People who make good choices shouldn't have to pay for someone else's bad choices. If anything, all that does is remove the incentive for good choices. I mean, why become an engineer or a surgeon and pay a ridiculous amount of taxes when you can work at a McDonald's and receive the benefits that those taxes are paying for. That's why socialism and communism are broken ideologies. Society can't survive or advance if being a scientist or an engineer or a doctor or any other career that actively promotes the growth and well-being of the human race is punished for their success through heavy taxation and wealth redistribution, but people who work in entry level jobs that provide little for society are rewarded and given preferential treatment.",

Before I was treated a hypomanic episodes looked like this:\n\nI\u2019d sleep maybe 4 hours but wouldn\u2019t be tired. \n\nGoal oriented activities dramatically increased. \n\nPhysical activity to burn off excess energy also increased. Like I actually qualified for Rio with my 1500m freestyle and 400m butterfly and rarely swam while depressed. I did a couple triathlons and tough mudder on a whim with zero training.\n\nI was taking back to back semesters with like 7/8 courses and would wait for an upswing to write all my papers in a couple days / read all the textbooks. \n\nI was far more social and I\u2019d do dumb reckless things.\n\n\n\nNow I rarely get hypomanic episodes and honestly I kinda miss them - but now when I get them they\u2019re much more mild:\n\nI sleep less and have more energy. It honestly just becomes a game of catching up everything I didn\u2019t do while depressed. \n\nMeds help with the depression. You\u2019ll find something that works.

For sure the \"light pollution\" can be a real distraction from the night sky, and I generally do my best to keep it at bay as much as possible (though I know in certain photos it's very prominent).  The real answer is, sometimes it's a composition choice, and other times it's inevitable.\n\nI live and thus primarily shoot in the greater Lake Tahoe area, and while we do have relatively dark skies, it's not exactly uninhabited. The lake is peppered with small to medium size towns, which might not appear to produce much light to the naked eye, but which really stand out when captured under long exposure.\n\nOn some of my photos, like [this one](https://phil.camera/PMM_4509-PanoFinalEdit_WEB.jpg), the bridges and a bit of man-made light were intentional and part of the concept I had in my head.\n\nThat's the big difference between a straight up \"astro photographer\" whose mission is to capture images of the sky, and an \"astro-landscape\" (sometimes called \"nightscape\") photographer like me who tries to capture images of the the night sky *with the earth for context*. What a great response, I\u2019m a classically trained large format photographer with no knowledge of \u201cAstro\u201d photography and really appreciate your insight. \n\nYour photos look amazing and has definitely motivated me to try my hand at the night sky!

That said, I recently watched a documentary called **'Cowspiracy'** \\[by the same dude who made Seaspiracy\\]. \n\nBasically what it comes down to, is that none of the leading 'environmentalist' organisations: Greenpeace, Oceana, WWF, etc. - none of them are truly addressing what the main cause of climate change is. I've learnt my whole life about carbon dioxide and fossil fuels and deforestation, but never really heard anyone talk about how harmful the agriculture business \\[rearing cattle for food\\] is. Consider this: the *leading cause* of deforestation is clearing land for agricultural use; the agriculture business releases more greenhouse gases than the entire global transport industry. \n\nI don't really know what I'm trying to achieve here, and I'm not trying to advocate veganism, although I think that doing it to save the planet trumps ethical concerns about animal cruelty. I'm certainly more open to it, but I just think that people need to know about this on a large scale. I truly don't think environmental organisations or governments are doing enough and honestly, we're the ones who are gonna have to deal w it all in the relatively near future. \n\nFor anyone who is interested in watching it, it's on Netflix.

I understand the need for a different approach after last elections drubbing (although I think the anti-Labour sentiment was much more about Brexit policy than it was about domestic policy) but Starmer has managed to sell out the party for no gain. I\u2019m looking at my membership dues going out on Tuesday and questioning why I\u2019m paying money to a party with no vision, no principles and no hope of winning. Yeah, I'm gone. Rejoined a few months ago out of naivety that if I stuck around and kept at it with the party on a local level, I might be able to make a difference in the right direction. Instead it's just made it most apparent that I'm not particularly welcome in the party and they'd rather I'm not there.\n\nLooks like I might upgrade my Unite membership potentially to give them pennies in order to try and change things if it arises, but I'm absolutely dinsenfranchised with the hodgepodge of shit of UK politics.",

Sounds like there's more money to work with. It's your choice how aggressive you want to be with paying debt but this board has a lot of enthusiasts for frugal living and fast payment. Is it better to refinance for a fixed interest rate of 3.91% with a minimum monthly payment of $1008 for 15 years with 44k interest but just pay more than my minimum so I pay it off faster? Like if I were to pay more than my minimum whenever I make a little extra cash from overtime, etc. I can potentially pay it off in 5 years and not have to pay 44k, correct?",

The past year and a half I\u2019ve had him appear in my dreams but no proper interaction. Lately, I haven\u2019t had dreams with him at all until last week. I remember seeing him and hugging him with both of us knowing how long it\u2019s been since we saw each other. Like a long lost friend but my dad. It was extremely vivid. I remember the shirt he wore, the wrinkles in his eyes, smell and pressure of his hug. He was healthy and content and asked me if I was ok. I said yes but of course I wasn\u2019t too sure because I miss him so much. I think I wanted to be honest and wanted to say I wanted him to stay. We had to say goodbye but I knew we were going see each other again so I wasn\u2019t as upset I woke myself up by literally breathing being in shock at what happened. I sobbed for two hours - 4 am in the morning because I didn\u2019t realize how much I needed that. I have this constant fear that memory of my dads hug will eventually fade but that dream brought me right back to it. It was surreal. \ud83e\udd70Such a beautiful story and visitation!",

The raw fact is that no one else has come even close to achieving what SpaceX has. And that isn't a fan boy take, its just a fact. For years now we've all talked about this as if it were a sort of larger emerging trend that includes many companies... and yet nothing has materialized outside of SpaceX. I don't think its a broad trend I think it's one exceptional company that every thought they could copy and is now failing. I used to root like hell for BO. Now they are a middle management nightmare filled with ex Navy officers in management roles and the entire company is unfocused and gridlocked and no, New Glenn is not launching this year or even next and that's just launching, not mastering landing and refurbishment. \n\nI used to believe it was a new broad trend but every year that passes convinces me I was wrong and its just SpaceX. Blue Origin turned into a modern version of old space/Boeing/Lockheed type companies and it seems like that was on purpose, based on who they've hired as managers and execs. You forgot about Rocket Lab. Sure, the size and scope is not the same as SpaceX, but they are doing their own thing, being innovative and so far very successful. I agree most of the \"new space\" is just SpaceX though. BO just hasn't delivered, and with each year without significant results, they seem less and less likely to really be able to compete.

I dated my HS sweetheart for 10 years before she developed a severe mental illness. I became her only caretaker for the last 5 and You have your own life and happiness to live for. And if being her caretaker is having this much of a detrimental effect on your mental well-being it\u2019s ok to say, enough is enough. The impulse control, sexual inappropriate behaviours etc are most likely linked to her mental health/ her new medications. A lot of medications can have increased sex drive etc as as a side effect. \n\nThough it\u2019s still hard to see/ hear. No sane women goes she wants a random dudes brother she knew years ago to give her a baby. \n\nHer family abandoned her and don\u2019t really know how extensive her mental illness probably is/ what level of care she needs/ how hard and draining it will be. And probably lack the capacity to deal. But they are her family and it is up to her parents to step up and care for her. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to take a step back and start prioritising yourself. If there\u2019s a way to even get her into an inpatient program, or whatever govt program to take over monitoring her, that would be a great option as well. \n\n\nBut your health and safety is just as important as hers and your priority. A lot of people really don\u2019t under the drain being a career to someone with high care needs. Wether that be from a mental health illness, dementia or whatever it is and how it can affect the person caring for them long term. \n\n\nYou have been there for her through a lot. But don\u2019t feel your stuck and obliged to stay. You might need a bit of respite assistance to have a break, or It may be time to start letting the family take over and it\u2019s your turn to start living your life.

Morocco has relatively few factories and very large businesses compared to China, EU, and North America. They have much, much more production. So naturally, fewer emissions from Morocco.\n\n2. Only about 12% of Moroccan adults own a car.  In many developed nations, at least 70% of adults own a car.  So naturally, fewer vehicle emissions in Morocco. I think Spain has 8 times as many cars as Morocco, for example. \n\n3. The third point is the most important of all: climate change is a global problem, and the absolute biggest emitters of carbon and methane are China, India, and America.  What they do effects the climate of the entire planet. So even if Morocco adopts a green and clean strategy, it still will be greatly affected by climate change because of what other countries do. The air and the sun do not have borders, the entire planet is warming and changing, not only the countries that pollute the most.  \n\nEven if Morocco continues on a green path, Morocco is such a tiny percentage of global emissions that it does not really solve the problem, because China and America continue to pump out enormous amounts of carbon and methane, and the wind and atmosphere spreads these gasses throughout the entire planet. Even green and clean countries will suffer from the pollution of other countries.",

Where we live if you have a Blue Cross insurance policy acquired through the ACA insurance marketplace the group number is 99EE or some variation thereon so you can spot them by looking at their cards.  (Our office doesn't accept Medicaid but that's a whole other problem.)  If a patient comes through with one of these, J will immediately defer their care to me or someone else, refusing to help them.  Then later if they have questions or need something from her she cops an outrageous attitude and is blatantly rude and curt with them.\n\nI have debated this, and other political topics with her, and her feelings are essentially that these patients are \"moochers\" because they got their insurance through \"Obamacare\" and don't pay for it.  I've explained that these policies have premiums just like employer-sponsored policies do but she refuses to believe this.  She then elaborates on how the ACA was a huge mistake because it \"enabled people who don't deserve health insurance.\"  We have a LOT of patients on Medicare and she has no qualms about treating them with respect and prompt service.\n\nAlso when a patient comes in who speaks Spanish and not English, if she hears me speaking Spanish to them (it's a second language for me, learned in school) she will become enraged and freak out, telling me that I cannot even speak to these patients because I am not certified as a medical interpreter (even if all I'm doing is telling the patients to fill out some forms).  I once asked J why we shouldn't be allowed to speak Spanish and she said, \"They could be saying all kinds of stuff right to someone's face, insulting them, whatever, and you'd never know because they speak some other language.  We can't enable that.\"\n\nJ is precious.  Being part of a tribe that is slowly being made to make room for people with differing origins, opinions, cultures, values, and lifestyles must be so traumatic for her.  Constantly in defensive posture against a world that no longer caters only to people like her.  Oh, and she's a Trump sycophant, but that goes without saying.  I'd say it's unbearable to be around her if it weren't so damn funny. I work in regulatory compliance. That kind of behavior can get a place\u2019s Medicare number revoked (they can\u2019t bill for Medicare or Medicaid, effectively causing the place to go belly-up). Call the health department anonymously. Have them set up someone to come in who speaks Spanish with a 99EE card. By reporting it yourself, they will likely cite your office and it will force their hand to fire her.",

A year and a half ago whilst I was in a relationship with an abusive ex, I was repeatedly r\\*ped on multiple occasions, the first time being the first couple of days after I started dating them. I have not consulted therapists nor told my family about it. Only two of my closest friends and my current partner know about the incident. Though I will not put in details of the specifics of the incidents, all of the incidents occurred whilst I was asleep or half-asleep (meaning I could not of given consent due to the state of my consciousness.) Unfortunately for me, I did some research after breaking up with my ex-partner and found out that I am the one that could have been arrested because I was 16 at the time dating someone 7 months younger than me (15). This could also be the case due to the power which their parents have, the parents of my ex are very powerful people, having much wealth to their name meaning they could take both me and my family down if they wanted to. If you have any questions on how I deal with the incident or any advice, that would be appreciated.\n\nI am open to answering all questions, triggering or not. I am here to give advice as well to anyone else who is currently struggling and to help you come to terms with your victimhood and sources to help you.\n\nAMA  \n\n\n\\[For the moderators of AMA, please [click this](https://imgur.com/a/Adnfia3) &lt;-- to see my proof.

Needless to say, ammo conservation was not a concern.\n\nThe reason why I suspect it may change in a subsequent patch is that the starter chests held the original amount, just in the new stack sizes (for the regular ammo, 3 stacks of 40 rather than 4 stacks of 30, and for the CLEO ammo, 2 stacks of 64 rather than 4 stacks of 32). Regardless, if you like Daybreak but always wished you could spray bullets willy-nilly, this is your chance! hmm.  interesting.

The Focus System is getting an extensive rework to refresh the gameplay potential of Operators, movement, School identity and balance. \n\n**WHAT IS FOCUS?**\n\nFocus has been a lot of things over the years. What started in 2015 as a pivotal decision moment in Warframe\u2019s story has continually evolved into its own form of gameplay:**Convergence** was introduced alongside Focus Lenses to give players an added boost to collecting Focus, **Update 22: Plains of Eidolon** shook the system up to add new Focus School nodes and Way-Bound abilities, and **Update 22.6** attempted to bring the 5 schools\u2019 power levels closer together with numerous abilities reworked. \n\nAt its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy Warframe from the lens of another character. What we\u2019ve come to realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that while also bringing something fresh to the table!  \n\n\n**OPERATOR GAMEPLAY REWORK OVERVIEW**\n\nThe **Operator Gameplay** and **Focus School** reworks aim to improve the flow between Warframe gameplay and Operator gameplay, with the goal of encouraging players to swap more frequently between their Operator and Warframe to maximize the benefits received from both gameplay systems. \n\nAs with all our major system overhauls, we encourage you to give it some time in your own hands before delivering your constructive feedback! \n\nFor Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly, re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host; thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe. \n\nVoid Sling is the intended replacement of Void Dashes as a more fun and controllable system. In full transparency, the current state of sustained Void Dash movement has a spam-centric loop that we want to refine. We are very much approaching this like how we added Bullet Jump to Parkour: we want movement to be king, but better controlled. Current Void Dash does not provide easily controlled movement in the typical gameplay spaces. We are aiming to strike a balance to ensure good distance can still be covered, but some re-mastery will be required of this new movement system (much like having to learn Bullet Jumping)! \n\nAdditionally, Operator Transference has been re-engineered to be Client-authoritative to alleviate the common scenario of latency. Previously, Transference was Host-authoritative, meaning when Clients used Transference the responsiveness was determined by the round trip network latency. In order for the new Void Sling functionality to be more responsive, the switch was made to be Client-authoritative. \n\n**Void Dash to Void Sling**\n\nThe Operator sends a Void Sling of themselves and then Void Slings to it. It is the Operator\u2019s \u2018Double Jump\u2019. ***After its debut on Devstream #160 and following further playtesting, the team has since increased the overall speed of the Operator\u2019s Void Sling thanks to feedback.**",

But the vast majority of boreal forest is designed to burn as part of their lifecycle. Cutting them down and replanting seedlings is preferable outcome to forest fires. The seedlings we planted were often pine and spruce, species that are most ideal for housing materials, but not ecologically exact copies of what was there before (more hemlock and birch typically). But I\u2019d say - a lot of the industry and government cares quite a bit. Planting seedlings is required by law, and it has a profound impact on reducing soil erosion and providing habitat. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine but you can\u2019t preserve a forest that is designed to burn - pine tar enhances burning and pine cones release seedling in the heat of a fire. Humans step in and use the wood, and then pick the cones to be heated so to release seedlings. Seems like the humans are doing their best to create a symbiotic relationship - it sucks we haven\u2019t gotten it sorted for all species and ecologists. Clearcutting an old growth forest that took several thousand years to establish and then planting a monoculture of seedlings could not be farther from a \u201ccycle\u201d. There\u2019s a reason why clearcutting old growth forests is discouraged by all ecologists who aren\u2019t in back pockets of logging companies. Some tree species will never return to a clearcut area due to a lack of upper canopy, such as the eastern hemlock. Unfortunately the rate we extract timber from forests is MUCH faster than the crawl of old growth forests. The mantra \u201cforests are designed to burn\u201d is a pathetic excuse for bleeding a natural resource dry.",

            "text": "**Context**: Querdenker (lateral thinkers) is the chosen name of the Corona restrictions resistance movement in Germany, frequently dismissed as idiots, Nazis and, of course, \"conspiracy theorists\".\n\nGermany currently has draconic restrictions in place that include:\n\n1) Mask mandates even outdoors, refusing to comply can result in lofty fines.  \n2) Vaccine, proof of Recovery, or a Test which is only valid for 72 hrs and will, starting next month, cost money, in order to participate in public life (museums, gyms, restaurants etc.)  \nThere is discussion of this being required for public transportation soon, as well ([Source](https://www.aerztezeitung.de/Politik/Plan-der-Bundesregierung-3G-Regel-in-Fernzuegen-422345.html))  \nThis is known colloquially as the \"3G\" rule (Geimpft, Genesen, Getestet)\n\n**The Incident:** On the 20th of September, 2021, one week before a major election for the new chancellor and parliament for the next four years, a anti-masker shot a 20 year old shopkeeper at a gas station in the head for telling him to wear a mask. He had forgotten his mask and was told to leave. He came back with a mask, then as he approached the cashier, pulled the mask down again. When told to put the mask back up, he shot them with an \"aimed shot to the head\".\n\nAs a result of this terrible incident, *#QuerdenkerSindTerroristen* (lateral thinkers are terrorists) trends on Twitter, with calls for Querdenker to be legally prosecuted, for anyone aligning with the ideology to be socially ostracized, and for future protests to be completely forbidden (which explicitly goes against our Basic Law, \u00a78 GG, which states that all German citizens are allowed to gather for peaceful protest). \n\nThey are ironically also calling for the group to be watched by the Constitutional Protection Agency, an agency so inept that they have stood by for one and a half years while massive portions of our constitution were suspended in the name of Corona. So of course, they have the group wanting to actually protect the constitution \"under observation\". I digress.\n\n**My Take (that no one asked for but you're getting anyway):** It reeks of a false-flag operation to smear the name of the only major resistance Germany has at the moment. The actions of this singular unhinged individual is being used to denounce and silence any and all criticism, and to denounce a group to which the perpetrator never admitted to being part of (as he has merely said that he is against restrictions). This is deeply ironic coming from the political camp who consistently protects demographics who have, in several instances, been responsible for killings and actual terrorist attacks (which have lead to an overhaul of security measures at events like Christmas Markets). \n\nAnd I bet you'll be hearing about it globally, soon, too, as a smear campaign against anyone who is anti-mask, anti-restrictions and anti-vaxx.\n\nThere was one particular statement on Twitter in the comments of a tweet by a bluecheck that bothered me immensely. It reads the following:\n\n&gt;*\" 20. Sein ganzes Leben vor sich. Es kann keine gerechte Strafe f\u00fcr eine solche monstr\u00f6se Tat geben. Armer Junge, ich weine um ihn und alle, die ihn lieben. Es ist langsam Zeit, damit aufzuh\u00f6ren, diese \u201ebesorgten B\u00fcrger\u201c mit so viel Verst\u00e4ndnis zu begegnen.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Translation: \"20. His whole life ahead of him. There can be no just punishment for such a monstrous deed. Poor boy, I cry for him and all who loved him. It is slowly time to stop meeting these \"concerned citizens\" with so much understanding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;([Source](https://twitter.com/Tirlilibird/status/1440002669318393859))\n\nThis particularly incensed me on a personal level. I am also 20, my whole life supposedly ahead of me. Well, I wouldn't know, as the Corona measures have stolen almost everything from me. \n\nMy preexisting depression became so bad I attempted suicide at several points between January and April of this year.\n\nThe corona-specific reasons for this are numerous.\n\nThe Uni closures. The isolation. The shutdown of any and all options to get out of the house and out of my own head. The upset to my own personal sense of righteousness and understanding of my country and the world.\n\nI lost not one but two jobs due to corona-induced circumstances. The first because the government did not protect us so-called Aushilfen (\"Helpers\"), which the victim also was, so when the \"nonessential\" shops closed, they couldn't pay us anymore, as we worked on a purely hourly rate and could not be put on furlough.\n\nI lost my second job because my dad's job closed his branch, despite it being a healthcare company, because they did not see the value in maintaining so many Homeoffice employees. As a full time Uni-student, at least on paper, my parents were extremely generous and helped me out with apartment costs. So when my dad's job was up in the air, I had to move back home and give up my second job, while my whole family suffered from the uncertainty of whether by dad would be able to transfer to a different branch, over an hour and a half away.\n\nI could not see my partner due to the border closures, over half a year we couldn't see each other, and Britain's Day 2 &amp; 8 tests are and were extremely expensive. Three trips were cancelled. They were one of the only things I had to look forward to in absence of literally any other activity or opportunity to make new friends and *live.*\n\n On one of my numerous attempts, my mom found me, and I was sectioned for two weeks in a closed ward. Came out with more trauma than I had going in. I got my vaccination early, because I needed to be able to be free again, so I bowed to the blackmail and the \"opportunity\" afforded to me by severe mental illness meaning I was placed in a higher priority group. I could not live like I did in 2020.\n\nI know, and I've been told in the past, that my whining is very selfish, and I know that. God, no one knows better than me that I'm whiny and selfish. But I know that my fate is far from unique, and VERY FAR from the worst. There are people who have had it so much worse. \n\nDuring my time in the looney bin, the only helpful conversation I had was with a nurse who came in to disinfect my room on my departure. She said she had never seen so many people in her entire career have to be put in the psych ward, especially not so many young people.\n\nAll this bullshit they spout about caring for people, for saving lives, what's the fucking point? None of us are really living anymore. People are dying, and they're dying alone rather than surrounded by loved ones. Old folks living out their twilight years in isolation.\n\nBut I'm a terrorist for saying that.\n\nIt's amazing how they forced these totalitarian restrictions for such a long period of time, and then manipulated and continue to manipulate people into begging for more and tearing those apart who dare protest, dare even question. \n\nEinigkeit und Recht und Freiheit, says our Anthem. It means Unity, Righteousness and Freedom. I don't see any of these in my country right now.\n\nSo forgive me for my tinfoil hat, thank you for reading, and rest in peace to the cashier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Source 1](https://www.spiegel.de/consent-a-?targetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fpanorama%2Fjustiz%2Fidar-oberstein-tankstellen-kassierer-nach-streit-um-corona-maske-erschossen-a-b40989e3-223f-4072-8bda-26bbf5c66d07&amp;) I'm from Germany as well and I'm sick of stupid Covid as well, I decreased my social contacts to a bare minimum for the first few months of the pandemic, I am missing the local events, parties and university campus. I still got myself vaccinated to easily access the gym and university without having to go to the test stations, not because I am scared of Covid. \n\nBut that murderer shouldn't be let out of prison anymore at all. He executed that harmless and defenseless young guy who only obeyed orders written in his contract for the uttermost ridiculous reasoning. \n\nHe came back after the first argument and teased the victim before killing the boy. The murderer just had to wear that little bit of cloth for about 20 to 30 seconds at best but he opted for the murder. Absolutely disgusting. \n\nBut one shouldn't lump all the anti-vaxers together, the people that celebrate an unjustified murder obviously are the small (but vocal?) minority",

Here is the link: [Book Giveaway #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WingifyBookClub/comments/pmqn85/book_giveaway_3_winners_announced_for_2/)\n\nWe had 11 submissions this time.  First of all, I struggled with this one (again). I had to read everything, and give marks based on the ideas and the quality of writing. I think its very hard to be objective with ideas as I might agree/disagree with them but its easy to be objective about the quality of writing. Anyway I went through everything multiple times and finally I decided on a winner! It is u/pi_yan_ka\n\nI will message you to get your address/contact details, and you will receive the book asap.\n\nAnyway, lets go to Book Giveaway #4.\n\nWe ran a [Poll](https://twitter.com/nifal_adam/status/1436974806742683648?s=20) to find the book of this week and it will be - **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari**  \nSapiens tells the history of Homo Sapiens from a completely fresh perspective. It explains that money is the most pluralistic system of mutual trust ever devised; that capitalism is the most successful religion ever invented; that the treatment of animals in modern agriculture is probably the worst crime in history; and that even though we are far more powerful than our ancient ancestors, we aren\u2019t much happier. Its an intense, thought-provoking book.\n\nTo win you have to answer the following question here in Reddit itself. We wont use Twitter for answers anymore. \n\n**Question**: I have been thinking about starting a new business with a goal to bring massive awareness to the Climate Change problem that we all face. So I was thinking about creating a nice \"Brand Mascot\". Our Brand Mascot will be a \"**Friendly dinosaur that warns people about climate change\"**. Now we want to give a name to this brand mascot, can you suggest a name? The only condition is that the \".com\" domain name should also be available for under Rs 1000 (You can check the price easily in namecheap.com). If we like the domain name we will buy it as well :)\n\n(Note: A brand mascot is the materialization of a brand's personality in the form of an animal or animated object figure, symbolic in nature, that stands as its spokesperson and representative)\n\nI thought this will be an interesting question because I have been thinking about this for a few days, I would appreciate some help haha. This is part of a crypto startup in the advertising space, I am writing the whitepaper and will hopefully have an MVP for private sale in 2 months.\n\n\\--------------- Footnotes ---------------  \n**1)** Bookgiveaway #2 book is received by the winners!

Instead paramedics and EMTs are pretty much the only ones used.  I think that ER doctors and nurses should drive or fly out to patients that require more advanced care.  Not something like someone broke a leg or something but stuff like a cardiac arrest, a birth, serious car accidents, neurological trauma, etc.  \n\nThis because their medical expertice and knowledge could be vital in saving someone's life and/or improve the care a patient gets.  Not to say that paramedics and EMTs provide bad care, they do they best they can with the knowledge that they have.  But ER doctors and nurses have had more and presmably better training in emergency medicine.  \n\nThis is currently already used in Belgium (see linked article above (it's in Dutch, French also available)), as well as in the Netherlands, France and Germany in some form or another.  \nThe way it is implemented in Belgium is that our ambulances are staffed with EMTs, we do not have paramedics.  Pretty much every large hospital has 1-2 cars that are staffed by an ER doctor and an ER nurse (and sometimes a 3rd person, either an EMT or an ER doctor in training) on standby like a normal ambulance (the doctor and nurse work in the ER department of the hospital when not out on the road) that our emergency dispatchers and ambulances can call it should the need arrise.  We also have 2 helicopters that perform this same role.\n\nThe main reason I'm posting this CMV is to see if I'm missing a reason as to why it might not be a good idea to implement something like this in other countries.  I know that there are developing countries where they simply don't have the resources to implement this.  Obviously in said countries the doctors and that are available should stay in the hospital but the goal should be to have enough doctors so that a system like this is possible in every country. At least in the United States, we have a shortage of doctors and logistically it makes sense that we should consolidate them to a hospital where each individual doctor can have a greater impact on more patients. \n\nIdeally, every medical professional would be of the highest level, but there is a greater degree of training and focus for those doctors, and especially ER doctors.  If someone has had a traumatic injury, the surgeons and doctors and ER nurses are probably better suited preparing for surgery than being on the bird or ambu and then needing to prepare for surgery once they arrive.\n\nI\u2019d be interested to see what the data is on the numbers of patients who died but may not have if a doctor-level skill was rendered in the pre-hospital environment, because I think the numbers are currently really good for the prehospital environment.",

For a small fee, which can be taken directly out of your paycheck by accounting, they will read this report aloud to you in a language of your choosing (Galactic Basic, Galactic Basic But With A Thick Scottish Accent, interpretive dance, etc.).* \n\nHoxxes IV is dying. You've all seen the signs on your drops. It's cracked half open, exposing its core - a terminal condition. Sometime within the next 100,000 years, the tidal forces exerted upon it by its several moons will rip the planet apart completely, sending its fragments hurtling into the sun (unnamed on survey maps but referred to colloquially by mining teams as \"Bertha\"). That the planet is breaking apart is clear both from the massive fractures and from its rings, which consist of ejected material from the dying world. This must be stressed: a world cannot survive the kind of damage Hoxxes has sustained. \n\nWhat killed it? None of the planet's moons, apparently, have formal names, in part due to the disappearance, dismemberment, Cave Psychosis, andd glyphid encystment suffered by all dispatched survey teams (as well as management's repeated insistence that \"we don't care what you call them, they don't have any gold\"). Still, the one visible on most drops bears a massive and obvious meteor impact. That must have occurred sometime in the last 10,000 years, as its outline is sharp and clear, meaning it has not been there long enough for other impacts to erase it. It seems clear that Hoxxes was not always tidally locked - rather, a massive meteor storm hammered the planet hard enough to shift its orbit (and that of its moons), scouring its now-lifeless surface and resulting in the present visible cracking. That crater on the unnammed moon (hereafter WBM-03, for Wet Bogman's Moon) is proof of this. \n\nBut we can be more specific. The Omoran Heartstone is clearly not native to Hoxxes IV. It is made of a substance not found anywhere else, and the locations in which it occurs seem to be impact craters. Heartsone's original habitat, if it has one, is a closely-guarded and highly classified secret, though per its name we can suppose it is a place called Omora. It must have arrived here as a meteor - probably part of the same storm that killed the planet. Little is known about Heartstone, but it appears to be quasi-living; perhaps its life cycle involves drilling down into the cores of planets using its laser crystals, at which point the Heartstone absorbs the energy powering the core and assimilates the planet's matter into itself. That done, it sends out more copies of itself - meteors that devastate and absorb yet more worlds. Thus, if the tidal forces don't destroy Hoxxes, the Heartstone will. \n\nIn this light, we need feel no guilt about the frankly horrific ecological devastation our mining activities wreak upon the planet. Also, our efforts to recover (for example) apoca blooms and booloo caps can be seen as conservation efforts, enabling Hoxxes' species to survive offworld, and have nothing to do with their extremely high market value as, respectively, an ice cream flavoring and powerful psychedelic. I like this, but I always really liked the headcanon someone had that Karl caused the giant crack on our Hoxxes",

            "text": " New US Crypto Regulation Far More Invasive Than We Thought\n\n**US Congress intends to regulate crypto on a level far deeper than currently understood\u2015They will:**\n\n* Designate Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks as commodities and regulate their transactions accordingly;\n* Create legal uncertainty for all other crypto projects and ICOs by allowing them to be labeled as securities;\n* Ban the use of (unauthorized) stablecoins;\n* Introduce penalties for the use of mixers and privacy coins;\n* Rebrand smart-contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver as futures contracts and regulate them accordingly;\n* Re-define legal tender and change the way money is created by the Federal Reserve; and authorize the issuing of a digital USD of which all transactions are recorded;\n* Introduce foreign regulations into US law for all virtual asset service providers in the US (and with US clients). This would not be done to then never use it.\n\n**In short: Congress wants to bring crypto-currencies under full oversight and control.**\n\nThese new regulations introduce massive regulatory burdens on existing projects, ban and criminalize current normal activities, restrain innovation and free enterprise, and even introduce a transparent central bank digital digital currency that redefines money as we know it!\n\nAccording to United States representative Don Beyer, congress should incorporate \u201cdigital assets into existing financial regulatory structures.\u201d(1) As you will see, they intend to do just that.\n\nAnd it will change the way things are done for crypto forever\u2026\n\n&lt;What This Post Is About\\_\n\nThis post provides an overview of the crypto legislation currently (September 2021) being put through US congress.\n\nIt does not just look at the proposed bills, but rather at the wide range of laws that are to be amended.\n\nOnce all the puzzle pieces are put together, the big picture reveals shockingly strict regulations of crypto and a complete overhaul of the idea of \u201cmoney.\u201d This could have serious effects not only on the crypto sector, but also on the financial system as a whole.\n\nBehind the excuses of preventing money laundering and ensuring investor protection, the use of crypto is transformed in something it was not supposed to be. Especially delicate is the fact that part of this legislation is drafted outside the US.\n\n***Disclaimer***\\*: This report provides a high-level overview of the US laws that are to be introduced/amended by two new bills. Its depth is limited by the inadequate knowledge of the author of the large body of US law involved, and given that these bills are subject to amendments and have not even passed into law yet, none of this information can be considered legal or financial advice.\\*\n\n&lt;What Is Going On?\n\nOn April 06, 2021, a \u201cmust pass\u201d bill was introduced called the \u201cInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\u201d(2) (\u201cInfrastructure Bill\u201d). It passed in the House of Representatives and, after fierce debate, the Senate. Hidden in this bill, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code was added. It introduced new reporting requirements and obligations for record keeping.\n\nWhile this bill created a lot of public outcry, more recently, a real game-changing bill was introduced in the House on July 28, 2021, namely the: \u201cDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act\u201d (3) (\u201cDigital Asset Bill\u201d).\n\nThis bill proposes amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, Securities Exchanges Acts, and the Commodity Exchange Act. It changes the definition of legal tender, and it introduces international crypto regulation into US law.\n\nThis article looks at each of these amendments\u2026\n\n&lt;Commodities or Securities?\\_\n\nThe main take-away is that two different bodies of law will apply to crypto projects: commodities and securities laws. So far, only Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks are confirmed to be commodities (see below). All other cryptos are subject to future guidance by market regulators:\n\n*\u201cNot later than 150 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish, for purposes of a 60-day public comment period, a proposed rulemaking that classifies each of the major digital assets.*\n\n***Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act***\\*, the SEC and CFTC shall jointly publish a final rule that classifies\\* ***each of the top 25 major digital assets*** *by (i) highest market capitalization and (ii) highest daily average trading volume as\u2014*\n\n*(1) a digital asset; or(2) a digital asset security.\u201d* (4)\n\nInterpretation:\n\n* Cryptos will be subject to two different regulatory regimes: commodities and security regulations.\n* Services engaged with both digital assets (commodities) and digital asset securities (securities) could be subjected to both regulatory regimes.\n\n&lt;Commodities Regulation\\_\n\nThe Commodity Exchange Act regulates the trading of commodity futures in the United States. Passed in 1936, it has been amended several times since then.(5) It provides federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges.\n\nIn 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was created to oversee the market. With certain exceptions, the CFTC has been granted exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures, options, and all other derivatives that fall within the definition of a swap. Certain cryptos will be regulated as commodities.\n\nDefinition of \u201cCommodity\u201d Amended to Include Digital Asset:\n\nFirst and foremost, Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act on definitions will be amended to read as follows:\n\n*\u201c****The term \u201ccommodity\u201d means*** *wheat, cotton, rice, corn, oats, barley, rye, flaxseed, grain sorghums, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Solanum tuberosum (Irish potatoes), wool, wool tops, fats and oils (including lard, tallow, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and all other fats and oils), cottonseed meal, cottonseed, peanuts, soybeans, soybean meal, livestock, livestock products,* ***digital asset (including Bitcoin, Ether, and their hardforks)****, and frozen concentrated orange juice, and all other goods and articles, except onions (as provided by section 13\u20131 of this title) and motion picture box office receipts (or any index, measure, value, or data related to such receipts), and all services, rights, and interests (except motion picture box office receipts, or any index, measure, value or data related to such receipts) in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.\u201d*(6)\n\nDigital Asset Definition\n\nNext, the end of Section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act will be amended by adding a clarification of what a digital asset is (7)(definition to long to post here)\n\nSmart Contracts with Delivery Time of More than 24 hours are Futures Contracts\n\nA sharpening of the definition of retail commodity transactions could decrease the options for the use of smart contracts outside of regulated exchanges.\n\nCurrently, Section 2(c)(2)(D)(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act prohibits persons that are not *\u201celigible contract participants\u201d* or *\u201celigible commercial entities\u201d* to engage in agreements, contract or transactions in commodities on leverage, margin, or financed by the offeror, the counterparty, or a person acting in concert with the offeror or counterparty on a similar basis.(8)\n\nNext, additional amendments mentioned in the SEC. 202 of the Digital Asset Bill applies this on transactions done by smart contract of which the delivery takes longer than 24 hours:\n\n*\u201c(ii) \u2002Exceptions*\n\n*(III)\u2002a contract of sale that\u2013*\n\n*(cc) with respect to* ***digital assets***\\*, results in\\* ***actual delivery*** *(including transfer of control over private keys) n****ot later than 24 hours after the transaction is entered into*** *and such delivery is accomplished by either-*\n\n*(AA) recording the transaction on the public distributed ledger for the digital asset; or*\n\n*(BB) with respect to digital which are not recorded on a public distributed ledger for the digital asset, reporting the transaction to a CFTC registered digital asset trade repository; or\u201d* (9)\n\nDodd-Frank Act and Market Transparency\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act introduced strict regulations for swaps. Naturally, these will also apply to digital assets as well.\n\nThe definition of swaps, as provided by the Commodity Exchange Act (section 1a(47)) is broad. For example, it could refer to any \u201cagreement, contract or transaction\u201d that \u201cprovides for any purchase, sale, payment, or delivery that is dependent on the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or the extent of the occurrence of an event or contingency associated with a potential financial, economic, or commercial consequence.\u201d (10)\n\nNext, the Dodd-Frank bill authorizes the CFTC to:\n\n* Regulate swap dealers by installing capital and margin requirements, require dealers to meet robust business conduct standards, and meet recordkeeping and reporting requirements.\n* Increase transparency and improve pricing in the derivatives marketplace by requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities and bring better pricing to the market place and lower costs for businesses and consumers.\n* Lower risk to the American public by moving standardized derivatives to central clearinghouses.(11)\n\nDigital Asset Trade Repository\n\nTo meet the above mentioned market transparency requirement, the Commodity Exchange Act stipulates the need for a digital asset trade repository to collect information on SWAPS in order to provide the public with the correct market information:\n\n*\u201cThe term \u2018digital asset trade repository\u2019 means any person that collects and maintains information or records with respect to transactions or positions in, or the terms and conditions of, contracts of sale of digital assets in interstate commerce entered into by third parties (both on chain public distributed ledger transactions as well as off chain transactions) for the purpose of providing a centralized recordkeeping facility for any digital asset, but does not include a private or public distributed ledger or the operator of either such ledger unless such private or public distributed ledger or operator seeks to aggregate/include \u2018off chain\u2019 transactions as well.\u201d* (12)\n\nInterpretation Commodities Regulations:\n\n* As of writing, only BTC and Ether (and their hard-forks) will be confirmed as commodities. All other cryptos could potentially be regulated as securities (what this means is explained next).\n* The fact that novel technologies such as Bitcoin and Ether are to be subjected to a large body of law that developed around the trading of livestock and frozen concentrated orange juice could spell regulatory uncertainty for various business models in the industry.\n* No \u201ctrading on margin\u201d is allowed outside regulated entities, unless done by high-level investors called \u201celigible contract parties.\u201d This could perhaps frustrate particular ideas about decentralized finance or OTC markets.\n* Smart contracts that take longer than 24 hours to deliver could be considered futures contracts under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. That smart contracts can be labeled as futures contracts appears indeed to be the opinion of the CFTC.(13)\n\n&lt;Securities Regulations\\_\n\nIn the US, securities are regulated by the 1933 Securities Act. Additionally, the 1934 Securities Exchange Act further regulates the trade of securities, and established the SEC to oversee these markets.\n\nDefinition of \u201cSecurity\u201d Amended to Include Digital Asset Security:\n\nFirst and foremost, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act will be amended to include a \u201cdigital asset security\u201d (and exclude \u201cdigital assets\u201d) in the definition of security:\n\n*\u201c(10)* ***The term \u201csecurity\u201d means*** *any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract,* ***digital asset security***\\*, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly known as a \u201csecurity\u201d; or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing;\\* ***but shall not include any fiat currency, commodity, digital asset***\\*, or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker\u2019s acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise limited.\u201d\\* (14)\n\nDigital Asset Security Definition\n\nNext, the Digital Asset Bill (SEC. 101) defines what a digital asset security will be:\n\n*\u201c(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The term \u2018digital asset security\u2019 means a digital asset that:*\n\n*(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:*\n\n*(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.*\n\n*(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.*\n\n*(III) Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the digital asset) of the issuer.*\n\n*(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer\u2019s liquidation.*\n\n*(ii) In the case of an issuer with a service, goods, or platform that is not wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with respect to* ***any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings***\\*) which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset, issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service, goods, or platform of the issuer.\u201d\\* (15)\n\nWhat does it mean to be regulated as a security?\n\nInvesting in securities in the US is regulated to:\n\n*\u201cprotect interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions.\u201d* (16)\n\nRegulations focus on both the issuing of securities (primary market), and subsequent trade of such securities (secondary market).\n\nThe goal of securities laws is firstly to require issuers to fully disclose all material information that an investor would need in order to make up his or her mind about the potential investment. A regulated company must create a registration statement, which includes a prospectus, with copious amounts of information about the security, the company, the business, including audited financial statements.\n\nNext, the subsequent selling and trading in these securities is regulated, by restricting trade to market places over which the regulator has oversight. The Security Exchange Act section \u00a778l(a) states:\n\n*\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any member, broker, or dealer to effect any transaction in any security (other than an exempted security) on a national securities exchange unless a registration is effective as to such security for such exchange in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations thereunder.\u201d* (17)\n\nSummary of Securities Regulations:\n\n* Crypto projects will need to be regulated and provide clear financial information for investors to make an informed decision.\n* Trading of securities will generally take place on regulated exchanges.\n* Any new fundraising or capital formation activity (including ICOs) are likely to be securities.\n* When a crypto is regulated as a security, the entire coin is subject to strict regulations. In the case of commodities, only specific use cases (futures) are regulated. It is a big difference.\n* US Congress is taking a leap of faith. It needs identifiable persons to enforce a law upon. Who is going to be held accountable in a decentralized network? Many issuing companies have handed control over to network participants. Perhaps for this reason, Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be amended to allow the issuer to apply for \u201cdesecuritization.\u201d (18) The question remains: who will apply for desecuritization once a network is decentralized? The investors? Weren\u2019t they the ones supposed to be protected in the first place?\n\n&lt;Changing the Nature of Money\\_\n\nThese regulations are not just about crypto. It is clearly part of a wider discussion on the future of money. As shown below, this bill not only changes the definition of money in the US, but also changes how money is created!\n\nAs a first, in Section 5312(a)(3)(B) of title 31, US Code (Money and Finance) digital assets are included as a monetary instrument.(19) However, Section 5103, of title 31, US Code will be amended to specifically exclude digital assets and digital asset securities as legal tender.(20) And finally, it is determined that digital assets and digital asset securities will not be covered by Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIC or NCUA).(21)\n\nIntroducing the Digital USD (or Central Bank Digital Currency/CBDC)\n\nAfter slamming the door on digital assets to be used as lawful money, the Federal Reserve Act is amended to provide the Federal Reserve Board with far reaching new powers; section 11 will be amended to say:\n\n*\u201c(d) To supervise and regulate through the Secretary of the Treasury the issue and retirement of Federal Reserve notes (****both physical and digital****), except for the cancellation and destruction, and accounting with respect to such cancellation and destruction, of notes unfit for circulation, and to prescribe rules and regulations (****including appropriate technology****) under which such notes may be delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve agents applying therefor.\u201d* (22)\n\nIn addition, Federal Reserve notes will in the future also be issued digitally; an amendment to section 16 confirms this:\n\n*\u201cFederal reserve notes, to be issued at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for the purpose of making advances to Federal reserve banks through the Federal reserve agents as hereinafter set forth and for no other purpose, are authorized. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is* ***authorized to issue digital versions of Federal reserve notes in addition*** *to current physical Federal reserve notes. Further, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, is* ***authorized to use distributed ledger technology for the creation, distribution and*** ***recordation of all transactions*** *involving digital Federal reserve notes. The said notes shall be obligations of the United States and shall be considered legal tender and shall be receivable by all national and member banks and Federal reserve banks and for all taxes, customs, and other public dues. They shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States, in the city of Washington, District of Columbia, or at any Federal Reserve bank.\u201d* (23)\n\nInterpretations on the Future of Money:\n\n* The door is shut for the use of cryptos as legal tender.\n* The Federal Reserve Board is to be authorized to create and distribute a ledger-based Federal reserve note that could be used for everyday transactions in USD.\n* Digital federal reserve notes will make the \u201crecordation\u201d of all transactions possible. Did they use this word because \u201cmonitoring all transactions\u201d would be too obvious? Recording all transactions without anyone looking at them makes no sense.\n* These amendments significantly increase the power of the Federal Reserve. Contrary to what is widely understood, the Fed does not \u201cprint money.\u201d It can only manage the money supply indirectly.(24) The private sector \u201ccreates\u201d most of what we use as money by issuing credit. It is with the supply of credit by the private banks that the monetary supply is inflated. Conversely, with the reduced demand for credit, the money supply deflates. The Fed is not as powerful as it wants the market to believe, and the Federal Reserve Act restricts a lot of its actions. This amendment, however, could drastically expand the authority of the Fed, by allowing them to create and distribute a \u201cdigital USD\u201d directly. It could change the entire structure of the financial system and potentially have far reaching consequences.\n* The original idea behind the Federal Reserve was for private bank deposits to be combined to provide an emergency line of credit in times of economic stress.(25) But if the Digital Dollar is based on a blockchain, how can it also be based on reserves? And what mechanism will determine how funds (and how much) are added to the economy? And where and how will they be distributed? What about privacy and security? Will all this authority be handed over to a board of seven unelected bureaucrats? This amendment has the potential to change the way the Federal Reserve operates. This deserves a wider discussion by economists and financial experts outside the crypto-space as well.\n\n&lt;International FATF Crypto Regulation Introduced in the US\\_\n\nThose paying attention to international anti-money laundering legislation know that the following sections from the Digital Asset Bill originate from guidance issued by the FATF (Financial Action Task Force). FATF is an intra-governmental organization [creating financial legislation](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/fatf-bitcoin-regulations-summary/).\n\nIn March, the Paris based FATF issued draft guidance(26) (\u201cFATF Guidance\u201d) on a number of topics. And even though this guidance hasn\u2019t been finalized, there are already a number of points directly included in the Digital Asset Bill.\n\nBanning the use of Stablecoins\n\nSubchapter I of chapter 51 of subtitle IV of title 31, United States Code, department of treasury regulation, will be amended, to read as follows:\n\n*\u201c(a) IN GENERAL.\u2014Beginning on the date of the enactment of this section,* ***no person may issue, use, or permit to be used a digital asset fiat-based stablecoin*** *that is not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection (b).\u201d*(27)\n\nCriminalizing the use of privacy coins and anonymizing services (mixers, coinjoins)\n\nThe bank secrecy act is going to be amended to sanction the use of anonymity-enhanced convertible virtual currencies and anonymizing services.(28) It is worth noting that willful violations of the bank secrecy act could give rise to a fine of not more than $250,000, or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.(29)\n\nIntroduction of the term Virtual Asset Service Provide (VASP) into US Law\n\nAs a next step, the term Virtual Asset will be introduced into Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code. A Virtual Asset can be a digital asset, or *\u201ca digital representation of value that can be digitally traded, or transferred, and can be used for payment or investment purposes;\u201d*(30)\n\nSo far we have seen a number of definitions. To understand their relationship, the following image was made based on the definition of Virtual Asset according to Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code:(31)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nVirtual Asset is a broad definition; it covers most activities involving cryptos. We can see in the Digital Asset Bill that entities that are facilitating transactions in Virtual Assets are to be called \u201cvirtual asset service providers,\u201d or VASPS. Sec 301 of the Digital Asset Bill defines a VASP:\n\n*\u201c(A) means a person who\u2014*\n\n*(i) exchanges between digital asset and fiat currencies*\n\n*(ii) exchanges between digital assets;*\n\n*(iii) transfers of digital assets;*\n\n*(iv) is responsible for the custody, safekeeping of a digital asset or an instrument that enables control over a digital asset;*\n\n*(v) issues or has the authority to redeem a digital asset; and*\n\n*(vi) provides financial services related to the offer or sale of a digital asset by a person who issues such digital asset; and*\n\n*(B) does not include any person who\u2014*\n\n*(i) obtains a digital asset to purchase goods or services for themself;*\n\n*(ii) provides communication service or network access services used by a money transmitter; or*\n\n*(iii) develops, creates, or disseminates software designed to be used to issue a digital asset or facilitate financial activities associated with a digital asset.\u201d* (32)\n\nThis definition comes directly from the FATF Guidance, with the only difference being that the US excludes the exchange between different forms of one virtual assets. On the other hand, section (v) is a new addition.\n\nThe Big Picture: Global Regulation\n\nThe logic behind this seems to be to first introduce a high-level definition (including coins regulated as commodities, securities, and everything in between). Next, any future global restrictions on the wider crypto-space can be applied at this level.\n\nFrom the latest FATF Guidance, a number of possible additional restrictions can already be deducted. Things to look out for are the restriction of the use of \u201cunhosted wallets,\u201d the introduction of the \u201ctravel rule,\u201d labeling those who engage in peer-to-peer transactions as a risk, and a whole host of other measures. (33)\n\nOne additional aspect of VASP regulation mentioned in the FATF Guidance is also included in the Digital Asset Bill; VASPS engaged in services which are available in the United States and to United States persons, have to be regulated in the United States, even if the provider is located outside the United States. (34)\n\nInterpretation International Regulation in the US:\n\n* International AML legislation, created by Paris-based FATF, is being introduced in the US.\n* The FATF term \u201cvirtual asset service provider\u201d (VASP) is introduced in the US. The definition is so broad that it covers practically all crypto projects.\n* After first being in the FATF Guidance, the banning of stablecoins and anonymity-enhanced cryptos and the obligation for VASPs to be licensed in the country of their clients are included in the Digital Asset Bill.\n* It is not hard to imagine that other restrictions for cryptos currently discussed by FATF, such as the travel rule and restricting unhosted wallets, will be introduced next. This is not a regulation you introduce to then never use.\n* All VASPs with operating in the US or with US clients need to be regulated in the US.\n\n&lt;Amendments in the Infrastructure Bill\\_\n\nLast August saw public outcry over the US Infrastructure bill. It included a section on IRS reporting for crypto. Some highlights:\n\nClarification of Definition of Broker\n\nIt makes sense that the tax authorities use a wide definition to cover all possible economic activities in crypto. Section 80603 of the Infrastructure Bill amendments the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, provides that brokers need to report the activity of their clients to the IRS and adds the following to the definition of broker:\n\n*\u201c(D) any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.\u201d* (35)\n\nReporting of Digital Assets\n\nIn addition, a unique wide definition of digital assets is added:\n\n*\u201cany digital representation of value which is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology as specified by the Secretary.\u201d* (36)\n\nEffective Date\n\nEffective after December 31, 2023. So there is time.\n\nInterpretation Infrastructure Bill\n\nThere was a lot of commotion about this bill. This was mainly due to the wide definitions used, which could cover all activities in the crypto space, including mining. In response, according to an article on Bloomberg, the U.S. treasury will shortly issue additional guidance, along the lines of the following:\n\n*\u201cOther firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market \u2014 from developers and miners to hardware and software providers \u2014 won\u2019t have any new requirements, so long as they don\u2019t also act as brokers, according to a Treasury official\u201d* (37)\n\nAt a glance, it appears that this bill is not as invasive as originally feared. It would also be impossible to enforce this legislation on miners due to the nature of the technology.\n\nIn this case perhaps it would have been better if clear definitions were used of what is, and isn\u2019t included. Moreover, comments from \u201canonymous sources at the treasury\u201d do not provide real regulatory clarity. This industry too easily accepts the opinions of officials as decree. But we are all, including officials, subject to the law. Given that officials change over time, opinions and guidance are not the way forward; clear laws are needed.\n\nThe commotion also distracted from the massive changes proposed in the Digital Asset Bill discussed in this post, which so far have been ignored by the industry...\n\n&lt;Sources\\_\n\nI added all 37 footnotes here, but the post become to long to post. For those who wish to check the footnotes, they can be found in the PDF version here:\n\n[https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Review-US-Digital-Asset-Regulation-September-2021.pdf](https://decentralizedlegalsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Review-US-Digital-Asset-Regulation-September-2021.pdf)\n\nInfrastructure Bill, [https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/)\n\nDigital Asset Bill, [https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4741/](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4741/)\n\n&lt;TL;DR\\_\n\n**Next to the infrastructure bill, a new bill was introduced in US Congress: the \u201cDigital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act.\u201d It is not law yet, could still be amended, and if it ever comes into effect it will likely not be this year/cycle. What it says:**\n\n**Bitcoin, Ether, and their hard-forks, are to be regulated as commodities. Smart-contracts taking longer to deliver than 24 hours are considered futures contracts and regulated as such.**\n\n**Every other project and future ICO is potentially a security; guidance will be issued by CFTC/SEC. Issuers of securities are likely required to provide transparency and financial information to investors. Trade is generally restricted to regulated exchanges.**\n\n**In addition, international anti-money laundering legislation is introduced in the US; Stablecoins, privacycoins, and mixers are to be prohibited. The high-level term VASP is introduced for almost all crypto projects, possibly to facilitate more future regulations.**\n\n**Finally, the Federal Reserve gets shocking new powers to create and distribute a central bank digital currency (CBDC), of which all transactions are recorded.** Tl /dr- governments can be onerous institutions. They do not exist to necessarily hurt or help, they are here to tax the crap out you.",

I'm going after a Class D licence to become a Security Guard because:\n\n1) I'm a loner type of person\n\n2) A Night Owl (e.g. I would still be up at night like up to 4am - 6am) which would be good for night shift jobs ( I think).\n\n3) Want to avoid jobs with lots of Customer Service like Publix ( I work there now as a Front Service Clerk \\[A Bagger!, Hate it, and the pay sucks for the job demand of Primer Customer Service and standing up for hours\\]).\n\n4)  At this point even if I can only do computer or programming projects as a hobby I just want a (more or less) stable full time job (with insurance, if not available; can still be on obamacare) with dealing with customers as little as possible (I'm 28).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's listed is just my ranting. Anyway is there a way to leverage my IT knowledge as a security guard in the future. I hate having my IT knowledge die! I want to be able to use it in the Security Guard field in some way like e.g. dealing with or troubleshooting the CCTVs or Communication Radios. Or maybe even my experimental Data Analyst or Web Development knowledge I tried teaching myself in the past . I know some Police Jobs encourage you to have IT degrees rather than Criminal Justice Degrees so I thought there maybe something similar for the Security Guard field. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeas, Thoughts? No.  You don't need any IT skills in security.  Most security systems are reception visitor or cctv systems.  The hardest IT I've done is make up photo ids with restricted access times or lift cctv images to an email.  Nothing that techy.\n\nObviously security companies have IT guys that support office staff, like with rosters, scheduling or payroll.\n\nYou're right.  You'll lose your IT skills and fall behind if you work security guarding.",

At the same time, many lower skilled workers have complained about job insecurity and flat wages. The best solution would be to recognise that global mobility can work both ways, and that emigration would be better for many individuals. Someone who has only completed highschoo might be low skilled in the US, but high skilled (can speak and write fluent English goes a long way) in somewhere such as India. In practical terms, this could look like going from a teller at Walmart, to a manager at the Indian equivalent.   \n\n\nWhile wages are certainly lower in the developing world, this does not naturally correlate with quality of living. A middle-class life in Delhi is probably better than a working-class life in Delaware.   \n\n\nWhile this policy proposal is unlikely to happen, I am often surprised how much pushback I get. Common arguments are:  \n\n\nThe rest of the world is horrible to live in:  Not True, just because it isn't the West doesn't mean it is war torn Yemen. I have travelled to 50+ countries, and many of them are safe, stable, and pleasant.  \n\n\nBeing poor in the West is better than being poor in the developing world: True, but if you're gunning for middle-class living, it is better to be in the developing world.   \n\n\nIt is hard to immigrate: Possibly, depending on country. Could easily be improved by negotiating with other countries, i.e. for every person who migrates from Kenya to the US, one US can have free travel to Kenya.  \n\n\nMy home is America: So often I hear this sentiment from people who breathlessly talked about how their ancestors fled Europe in search of a better life. You are now your great-great-grandfather, knowing that greater opportunities exist for you in Asia, but refusing to do so, because *reasons.* The issue with this is people often already don't want to move to a different part of the country when it's in their \"economic best interest\", let alone a different country all together. \n\nThere's a lot of people who would have an extremely easy time finding a job and affording a nice house If they moved to a more rural part of a different state. \n\nPeople tend to have roots in whichever place they live, and there can be other costs to moving. \n\nIf people don't want to move to another part of the country they're not going to want to move countries.",

We got married after about a year together, as he was moving from Europe (where I'm from) to the US (where he has spent all of his adult life) for a job, and it was the only way to stay together not long-distance.\n\nWe have a large income difference. I earn about 20% of what he does. He has also been in a well-paying job for a long time, whereas when we met I was finishing my PhD. He has no debts, I have UK student debt in the form of a graduate tax (e.g. it just comes straight out of my paycheck and they advise you to not pay it off more than that).\n\nWe got pre-nupped up when we got married. I am not entitled to alimony, or anything he earned before our marriage. It's a fairly boilerplate pre-nup.\n\nWe're now talking about buying a house together. We found somewhere we like and put in an offer. Stupidly, we didn't have fairly vital conversations beforehand, and now there's a bit of conflict.\n\nWe are both putting in 2/3 of our respective savings, but the actual $ amount is wildly different. I am putting in about 10% of what he is as downpayment. We would split ongoing payments (mortgage, insurance, utilities) proportionally moving forwards, as we do currently while renting.\n\nI have sacrificed several years of career to move to somewhere I couldn't work, in order for him to further his. We now live in the UK, where we can both work and I have worked my first 2 years back here on lower pay than I earned as a PhD student (my PhD was well paid) and I'm about to start earning equal to that again next month. I also burned through all my past savings while living in the US so that he wasn't bankrolling me. I see those, and certain other sacrifices including future mobility, that I have made as being a valuable contribution that should be recognised.\n\nHe has taken a pay cut to be in a country where we can both work. He has taken about a 30% cut. He is concerned that if anything were to happen with our relationship, he would lose money that he has worked very hard for and I would make a profit, after taking this pay cut to be in a place where we can both work.\n\nSo, the crux is I was expecting that we would be joint owners of the house. He would like me to have a much smaller proportion - probably 70-30. To me it is an issue of committment and equality. He is looking at it mostly financially. AITA for expecting parity in this?\n\ntl;dr - couple with big income differential who were too dumb to have a big conversation before getting far in the house-buying process are now disagreeing as to how ownership should be split. I am the lower-earning half of this couple, and had assumed (and want it to be) joint, 50/50 owernership. AITA? 70/30??? Nah fam. Your husband is a little transactional and is already expecting something to happen to the marriage and preparing to cover himself only, when you both have made sacrifices for each other? \n\nI would not be okay with this. I would cross post this To r/legaladvice to see if there are better alternatives",

            "text": "As the title states, I am a nursing student with severe regrets in my choice of profession. I would do anything to go back in time and prevent myself from choosing this career. I find myself dreading every clinical day, and I absolutely despise making small talk with patients, doing bed baths, turning heavy patients, trying to remember a bunch of tedious medications that I don't give a shit about. My back is already in fucking pain after only 6 hours on the floor. I am wildly incompetent at most things nursing-related, fumbling with the vital sign machine and forgetting basic parts of physical assessments. Although I do enjoy learning about the human body and disease processes in many of my nursing classes, this field is nothing like what I expected it to be and I can't see myself remaining in it for the rest of my adulthood. \n\nI wish that I had chosen a career with the possibility of being \"boss\" one day; in nursing, I will always be following the doctor's orders and complying to the demands of complete strangers. Fuck, when I told my roommate this year that I am a nursing major she immediately asked \"why didn't you become a doctor\" which reveals the utter lack of respect that many people have for this career. \n\nI entered nursing for all of the wrong reasons: for the stability, the predictability in coursework, and for my moderate (but not particularly intense) interest in the human body. I fantasized about the lucrative option of pursuing nurse anesthesia (CRNA), but I don't think that I will even be able to tolerate the necessary years of ICU experience to get there. \n\nMy boyfriend is premed, and I envy him so much. Yeah, his classes are much harder than mine but he will eventually get the satisfaction of being an expert in his scientific field and not having to lift a single patient while making serious $$$. He also doesn't have to take bullshit nursing theory courses and gets to fill his ample free space with fun electives. Although I am somewhat considering medicine myself, the difficult prerequisites and the prospect of taking on even more student debt is quite daunting. \n\nI am thinking of going into **accounting** or **software development**: something very dry and very boring with minimal human interaction. Or **writing**. I am a great editor with a strong command of the English language. Sure, maybe it doesn't pay as well as nursing, but my sanity is worth its weight in platinum. As an extreme introvert, I am only becoming even quieter with age.  \n\nBut even with all of this regret, one blessing in my life is my relationship with my boyfriend; we are both very serious and seem to be heading in the direction of marriage. He wants me to support him with my nurse's salary while he is going through medical training before having kids. But I literally can't stand the thought of still being a nurse in 5 years. I need to change career fields ASAP. \n\nSadly, it is too late to change my major as I am a little over a year away from graduating. I am so demoralized right now that I am considering dropping out of school all together. All of my free time away from studying is spent desperately researching special masters programs or learning how to code. I am too ashamed to even tell my parents how I am feeling right now. Hey, it\u2019s really amazing that you\u2019re figuring this out now. Nursing can be brutal and it\u2019s only getting harder with everything that\u2019s going on in healthcare right now. There are directions you can go with a nursing degree that aren\u2019t direct patient care. Research, informatics, policy, all is not lost. A nursing degree is valued in many fields. \n\nIf you\u2019re able to complete your education and pass you\u2019re boards, I encourage to do so. (Maintain your license with required CEs bc that test sucks.)\n\nI\u2019m an RN who injured out of the field in 2017, now I\u2019m a project manager for a grant funded health program. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll head once this is over, but I have my RN education and PM experience to leverage. \n\nAllnurses.com might be a helpful resource, however much of it is geared towards direct patient care. I really want to stress this point: it\u2019s amazing that you\u2019ve figured this out for yourself now, rather than being brutalized working in the field. Congratulations on knowing yourself and taking steps towards finding a career that is better suited for you \ud83d\udc97",

Doing it in house requires redundant systems, backups off-site, administors, network infrastructure, etc.  \n\nAt the midsized business level, it is cheaper to outsource your high end storage needs.  \n\nBut that scale is epic.  A well run shop would be better in house, probably, particularly if you already have a big IT shop.   \n\nSo to your point... Moving from 10 tb of redundant and backed up storage to 110 tb of redundant and backed up storage is a huge jump in cost.  Moving from 100 tb to 1,000 tb is not nearly as big of a jump.   You already have all the most expensive parts.  The drives and shelves are relatively cheap next to the other hardware and engineers.  \n\nOf course, doing it right would mean that there is no separate project level storage.   In fact, since it is all federal government, there should not be any of that devolved to departments.  One giant data management service to handle everything would be most efficient.  Just bill back for level of service and amount used.  \n\nIf I was the NASA CIO, I would definitely consolidate all IT services across these projects.  It would save millions at the NASA level.   Many billions at the federal level.  \n\nBut I couldn't even convince my local county to consolidate telephony across all departments. Nobody wants to give up control.   So every department buys and manages their own system.  Even though all the major players have IP based systems that could easily handle the whole thing on one platform.  And then every department could have access to a too of the line  Genesys IVR and call center solution that most could not afford or justify on their own.  \n\nNope.  Each separate department wants control.  So they spend more to get less.   \n\nThe same goes for storage, server management, networking, backup....  There is a huge advantage to having great scale. Unfortunately, each satellite has different rules on when data can be released to others and when. Juno was the first Flagship mission that releases all imagery to the public immediately. Not so with other data. The principal investigators (science team) want to be the first to analyze the data and publish discoveries before anyone else. While I understand the politics of the situation and that  ultimately the Federal Government has an ownership interest in all the data, some of the data is controlled (owned?) by the provider of the sensor which usually involves another space agency and the principal investigator.\n\nPutting all the data into one huge database may be problematic.",

For example, if my general pcp visit usually costs me a $20 copay on my PPO plan, what would it cost me out of pocket with the HDHP? What would medications cost me? Thanks for any help. I've found that high deductible health plans are really about betting that your short term health won't have any issues.\n\nIn the long run you'll have a pile of cash with market gains and employee contributions year over year.  So there's potential benefit.\n\nHowever.  These are HIGH DEDUCTIBLE plans so if something did happen earlier on you'll pay out of pocket more and without the cushion of savings over  years.\n\nI've also found that my PPO plan compared to my HDHP plan is a wash from a savings perspective.\n\nI'd rather pay an extra 100/month that if my family broke a bone, had unexpected hospital stays, etc that we'd be protected with a low cap from total out of pocket expenses.\n\nI'm risk averse though.

As we know, this leads to the games filling up with guns that take 30+ rounds to kill a human target. I don't like that. I also wouldn't want fallout (5) to become any more simplified of an fps than FO4 already is.\n\nGuns don't work like that irl. (Crazy, I know), and why does this matter? It's just a game right? Usually, I would feel that way, but when you're playing a game set after an apocalypse, where resource conservation is an important element, it seems extra silly that it takes ~20 rounds of 9mm to put a regular person down. Even more silly- multiple shotgun blasts to the chest.\n\nI understand that FO needs a ton of damage headroom for their stats to work out, so why not change what the stats actually govern? More emphasis on accuracy via stress management in combat, instead of some bizarre system in which a human enemy is perfectly fine until they've been plugged with exactly 7 rounds of .308.\n\nThose are just my thoughts tho.

I was already a bit of a drinker before, but it just went completely off the rails in the last year and a half. And after trying extraordinarily hard to get off the stuff several times on my own, I've arrived at the conclusion that I *need* a medical detox. It's truly a physiological, medical problem for me. \n\nI haven't had insurance since I was eighteen and got kicked off family Medicaid, so the handful of times I've had to go to the hospital in the twelve years since then I've just gone to the ER (relatively minor stuff like a few stitches), gotten taken care of, and just ignored the bills. \n\nIn the last couple of years I've rehabilitated my credit quite successfully, I'm 700+ with both TransUnion and Equifax, still around 570 with Experian because they seem to be the only credit agency that is registering my student loans, but even with regular monitoring of my credit score I've not seen any register of any unpaid medical bills. This is after years.\n\nI understand that if I just show up at the ER, they have to treat me. My question is what is going on with this seeming lack of consequences for doing so and ignoring the bills. I can't pay them, but I need the treatment, because this problem is ruining my life.\n\nI also recently moved to a different state and, because of their different handling of Obamacare, applied for insurance and was approved for a plan at no cost to me through subsidies, but of course with a deductible, but which doesn't go into effect until July 1st. This has to affect the payment dynamic - I dont know if the relatively minor ER visits from the past have just been written off by the hospitals or something because I was uninsured, but if I'm insured and do this after the plan has gone into effect the insurance company will be the ones in charge of getting the deductible paid, and will likely be a lot more aggressive and even litigious about it, right?\n\nI don't know why the past medical bills have seemingly never caught up with me, but should I just go to the ER before July 1st? Should I cancel the insurance plan altogether? Am I right in thinking that the payment dynamic changes once you have insurance and a deductible? Do these hospitals just write off bills as long as they're not obscenely high?\n\nAll I'm trying to do is avoid complete financial ruin. Again, I understand how irresponsible all of this is, and I'm appropriately embarrassed, I'm just genuinely looking for information or advice because I'm trying to find the best way to get my life back on track while also not completely financially screwing myself for the rest of it. Yet you haven\u2019t gone to AA or sought the help of anyone outside the developing plan to go to the ER? Sorry but you can\u2019t expect to just avoid all cost associated with your problem. People go cold turkey to quit various forms of addiction. Give that some thought and seek the help of a group with resources to address your illness",

A much bigger source may be that France has shared crucial details about the submarine design, future updates, and French manufacturing capabilities that have not been shared with the US or UK. As the nations compete for commercial sales of submarines (military and non-military purposed), this is very important competitive intelligence to have. More generally, some details are best never shared even with allies unless absolutely necessary \u2014 the more people who know a secret, the more likely it will be leaked to an enemy. While Australia would have had those secrets if they continued with the deal, they would likewise not want to share certain details to protect the security of their own subs, and France would at least get the money.

We know what's innocuous and what needs treatment or further investigation because of our years of training and experience, and we still err on the side of caution (and even then we get it wrong and miss things).  Your average person doesn't have any of that expertise, or the reassurance of normal obs.\n\nPersonally I'm a minimiser, I rarely go to the GP, I'll just take some pain killers and wait and see, and I was like that before medicine. But that's my personality type and I can't really blame other people for not being able to tolerate that uncertainty. \n\nSo I'm very sympathetic to the 'worried well' who just have no idea and need a bit of reassurance. I'm much less sympathetic to people who want inappropriate treatment (the abx for a cold patients).",

Despite what some might say, it is still on him to take responsibility for his mental health and how his condition negatively impacts those around him. It took him getting kicked out another time and getting arrested to finally understand what was going on with him.\n\nAs far as what to do now, I would send a message saying just this \u2014 that he can\u2019t put the blame on you and you shouldn\u2019t have to take it when you stuck your neck out for him.

Please feel free to agree, disagree, discuss or link scientific articles you believe support or disprove some theories explored here. \n\nA little background :\n\nFull disclosure, I do NOT have a degree in physics or anything. My knowledge of physics comes from my bachelor's in computer engineering and it's limited to mechanics and electromagnetism.\n\nMany-worlds theory:\n\nHowever, I've always been an enthusiast of the cosmos, the unknown, the universe. Recently, I have been learning about quantum theory - particularly, the many-worlds interpretation of superposition and entanglement of a system. This is the scientific theory the OA is based on, it's quite an eye opener and I highly recommend you check it out. Derek from Veritassium has a great video breaking down this interpretation of quantum physics : https://youtu.be/kTXTPe3wahc\n\nGoing beyond:\n\nNow the fun part is how the show builds on this scientific theory by introducing the human consciousness as the key element. The wave function that describes the entire universe (or system)  collapses when we measure a sub-system. In other words, when we measure the outcome of some entangled sub system within that system, we determine the probabilty of that outcome and thereby split (or \"fork\") the universe into those worlds. For Nina, it was the choice to get on that bus, she became entangled with the system therefore collapsing the wave function and forking the universe into 2, one where she grew up happily with her father, the other without. But all worlds, all forks, all parallel universes, dimensions exist and are described by the single wave function. It's like each entagled system can be described by a function, and a group of these systems make up the universe (many dimensions make up the entire universe) and are therefore described by the sum of that function. Are you still following? OK! \n\nHuman Consciousness:\n\nThere's a great book called Stumbling on Happiness by Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist who describes that the key difference between humans and every other species on this planet is our ability to predict and plan for the future. \n\n\nSo where exactly does the human consciousness play a part in all of this? Well I think this is still a work in progress in the scientific community. Neurologists and biologists alike have mapped the human anatomy and the brain, yet they haven't been able to successfully  pin point where exactly our consciousness resides. The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed, it changes form.  When we die, our flesh undergoes many processes, turning into gas, getting absorbed by the soil, the bacteria, and many other transformations. But what happens to our consciousness? We go to the conservation of energy, which states that energy in a system cannot be created or destroyed, it just changes form from one to another. Whether our consciousness is categorized as matter or as energy, it follows the same principle, it transforms. This is what the show, what Hap was trying to prove. The show goes even further by building on to the many-words interpretation of quantum theory, and linking human consciousness to transform within this system in the form of other dimensions existing in this one big thing we call the universe. It could also be called the multiverse depending on your interpretation of the concept. \n\nGoing even further beyond (the Egg theory) :\nThis is where it gets even more fun and what the show could do if it ever gets a season 3. I'd rather just refer you to an explanation : https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI\nWith each \"death\" we cultivate a higher being like the person OA saw when she had her NDEs. I think there's a reason the show had her dressed in what looked like an Indian Sari. The Bhuddist interpretation of afterlife and nirvana is exactly what egg theory describes. Now I don't know if this is too far fetched, feel free to let me know. \n\n\nThere has been mass studies done on human consciousness impacting the probability of events in our reality. The research I will link you is this:\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550830711002321\nThe abstract should give you a broad summary, but to specify a bit, neurologists conducted research where they had over 65 stations around the world recording 200 bits seeded by entirely random events (such as a lightning strike) and during times of mass crises or public decisions (like an election as an example) there were clear patterns observed in these 200 bits. Linking this to the many-worlds theory, we can speculate that humans can consciously \"will\" the collapse of the wave function during entanglement by manifesting the reality they will. \n\nThank you for reading my TED talk. \nLet me know what you think. The brain and the universe are connected.",

I can borrow $200K at 2% for 30 years. I would have a positive cash flow from day one. If you think we are going to see big bad inflation, as I do, having a secured debt at 2% is very tempting.

At the same time, many lower skilled workers have complained about job insecurity and flat wages. The best solution would be to recognise that global mobility can work both ways, and that emigration would be better for many individuals. Someone who has only completed highschoo might be low skilled in the US, but high skilled (can speak and write fluent English goes a long way) in somewhere such as India. In practical terms, this could look like going from a teller at Walmart, to a manager at the Indian equivalent.   \n\n\nWhile wages are certainly lower in the developing world, this does not naturally correlate with quality of living. A middle-class life in Delhi is probably better than a working-class life in Delaware.   \n\n\nWhile this policy proposal is unlikely to happen, I am often surprised how much pushback I get. Common arguments are:  \n\n\nThe rest of the world is horrible to live in:  Not True, just because it isn't the West doesn't mean it is war torn Yemen. I have travelled to 50+ countries, and many of them are safe, stable, and pleasant.  \n\n\nBeing poor in the West is better than being poor in the developing world: True, but if you're gunning for middle-class living, it is better to be in the developing world.   \n\n\nIt is hard to immigrate: Possibly, depending on country. Could easily be improved by negotiating with other countries, i.e. for every person who migrates from Kenya to the US, one US can have free travel to Kenya.  \n\n\nMy home is America: So often I hear this sentiment from people who breathlessly talked about how their ancestors fled Europe in search of a better life. You are now your great-great-grandfather, knowing that greater opportunities exist for you in Asia, but refusing to do so, because *reasons.* Not sure you understand late-stage capitalism.

Tecfidera makes me flush anyway so I\u2019m ok with changing.",

Doc has been giving me samples the last two months as we figured out doses because it\u2019s an expensive med that we knew insurance was going to fight me on. We finally settled on 3mg so he called it in. Of course insurance wanted to prove I needed that vs a cheaper atypical antipsychotic. So we went through that process and for my migraine meds that\u2019s always meant a 30 dollar copay (my other meds are all 5 dollar or below. I have crap insurance if I get hospitalized but medication coverage as long as we go through CVS it\u2019s not so bad). So I get the discount card from the doc that should give me two months free then 15 dollars there out vs 30 (you can print this offline too for all who don\u2019t know). I go to pick it up today along with my migraine med and other two meds and my total cost is 35 dollars. Erm. So I was like does that include the Vraylar? And she said yeah you have a zero copay on that. Um. What? Lol. Vraylar at CVS without insurance is like 1300 dollars and some change (not kidding) my migraine med is 600. You\u2019re telling me I have to pay 30 dollars for one of these but the more expensive one you are totally covering? I mean I\u2019m not at all complaining just absolutely shocked lol. I\u2019m fully prepared it\u2019s going to somehow be 30 next month (which is also fine. Others pay way more I know). But what a pleasant surprise to save 30 bucks today lol. Just had to share because it was quite exciting lol. I hope someone can pitch in here but isn\u2019t there an app or website that comparison shops local pharmacies?  I know it\u2019s out there but I can\u2019t remember the name.",

And redoing our roof so we can have skylights and solar installed. We avoid anything in a plastic container, opting instead for glass aluminum or buying in bulk (and then using our own glass containers).

I spoke with the conservator and talked about looking for potential internship opportunities and she offered me one on the spot.

Depends on your career path. Some make more use of a masters degree than others. I'm a director in continuous improvement, and for my career path, certifications matter much more than a masters degree (I don't have mine and make 147k per year). Most companies won't increase your salary after graduation unless you take on a new higher position. There's no incentive for them to pay you more if you stay in the same role. People will say \"I know a person that got 30k more per year after getting their masters degree\" or something like that.That person took on a new position after graduation. Depends on if the degree helped them or not to get that position. But from my experience in logistics, masters degrees are becoming much less \"required\" for senior positions nowadays. So if I were you, I'd focus on career path and look at positions that interest you in the future. Then take a looks and see if a masters degree is \"required\" or \"preferred\".",

The latest one lasted about 8 months and was triggered by a little global pandemic you may have heard about. I experienced complete anhedonia, appetite totally disappeared, an inability to focus on anything, an inability to do basic household tasks like cooking and cleaning, irritability, fits of rage, sobbing meltdowns that lasted for hours. I came the closest I ever had to suicide, took the step of acquiring a method, but fortunately had the self-preservation to tell my partner about it. A \"good\" day was just one in which I didn't have a suicidal meltdown. I think I went through months without feeling any enjoyment or joy whatsoever. I'm sure all of this is stuff you can relate to. \n\nWorth mentioning that immediately prior to starting Marplan, I did a course of 36 sessions of transcranial magnetic stimulation. I would say this was about 30 - 40% helpful in getting me out of the hole I was in. I've also been on Lamictal, Cymbalta, Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Lexapro previously. \n\nI started Marplan on June 9th, so it's been just over a month. I started at 20mg and within 10 days bumped up my dose to 40mg. I've been on 40mg for a little over 3 weeks. \n\nI'll give the bad news first: at 40mg, I got hit hard with a few significant side effects. \n\n* Urinary retention. This is a rare one on Marplan, I just got lucky. I had to pee constantly, felt like I couldn't fully empty my bladder, and was sometimes getting an intense ab workout to be able to pee at all. This was worse when lying down, especially when trying to sleep, when I had to get up every 15 minutes to try to pee again. My doctor prescribed Flomax, an alpha blocker, and this has pretty much resolved the issue. \n\n* Insomnia. This was really rough, lots of lying awake at night trying to trick my brain into falling asleep. At first I could only sleep at all with a combination of Gabapentin &amp; Ativan, but my doctor prescribed me a low dose of Seroquel, which has done the trick. It makes me feel a little weird physically so I might try something else, but it definitely works. \n\n* Low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension. UGH. As annoying as the other 2 are, this is my least favorite. It does seem to be improving, and I've found some tricks that help, but I basically spent 2 - 3 weeks glued to my couch because doing ANYTHING made me so dizzy I almost passed out. Standing would cause me to hear ringing and then white noise in my ears, feel really weak, and then my vision would start to go dark. At one point my standing BP fell to 77/44. Not fun. The things that have helped the most: \n\n * Constant hydration, especially with things like Pedialyte and Gatorade\n\n * Licorice root capsules\n\n * Salt tablets\n\n * 20 - 30mmHg compression stockings (quickest and most notable difference with these)\n\n * When feeling passable, very slowly walking on the treadmill and then gradually increasing speed to raise BP through exercise. \n\n\nGood news: I'm feeling so much better mentally/emotionally! I am no longer suicidal. I wouldn't say that I am in 100% remission, but most importantly, I feel like I have the hope and motivation to make my life better and more fulfilling, whereas I was just trapped in a dark hole before with no ability to do that. I no longer wake up feeling like there's a huge weight on my chest and the walls are closing in. I am not irritable, not having sobbing or rage meltdowns, and I generally feel less anxious. My appetite and enjoyment of food came back, which is huge! I have more motivation to do household stuff, though the hypotension is still somewhat limiting. I can laugh at things. I am interested in increasing my dosage (40mg is the lowest therapeutic dose) to see if there's more benefit, and there's a lot I still have to get in place to be happier in life in general, but I feel like I have the potential to actually do those things. \n\nWhat I wish I would have known before starting: I was mostly focused on the tyramine-based food restrictions, but those haven't been an issue at all (though I have avoided the big offenders of aged meat &amp; cheeses, which aren't a normal part of my diet anyway). I wish I would have prepared for the other side effects, especially the hypotension, which seems to be the most common across the board. I would have bought all the helpful things (hydrating liquids, supplements, compression stockings, a good BP monitor) before starting Marplan. \n\nAlso, wanted to add that my insurer covers this drug with a maximum $75/month copay, which is how I'm able to afford it. I know it's insane out of pocket. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions! I'll keep posting periodic updates. Awesome to hear you are doing better! I\u2019m starting marplan soon, just waiting on the pharmacy. Parnate caused agitation / rage for me so I\u2019m glad to hear marplan seemed to help you with those things! Nothing worse than being agitated and depressed. \n\nDid your depression/anxiety ever cause you to feel out of it, foggy or numb ? If so has marplan helped any with that?",

You know, I've always had a hard time answering that question I can never think of a way to answer it without feeling cliche Even back in my elementary school days It also appears no one else is on this chat right now So I can chat about whatever I want! Anarchy! But seriously There are plenty more adventures to be had Today's story will follow the characters Xander, Harold, and Quincy Xander: hello friends! How would you like to go skiing? Albert: if you bring the poles, I'm in! Xander: Albert? I, uh, don't know any Alberts... Harold: haha, just kidding. I'm actually Harold. As I was saying, I just don't want to rent poles this time. Xander: no worries, I can cover for you. I have extras. What about you, Quincy? Quincy: I don't know...last time I went skiing was a bit of a fiasco Xander: why, what happened? It was that bad? Quincy: yeah. I crashed into a hot dog stand at the bottom of a super steep slope Harold: that's awful! Quincy: there was ketchup and mustard everywhere. Xander: ok, well, this time will be different! We can get you skis that fit well... Quincy: I'll think about it. When are you planning to go? Xander: oh, I was thinking like 5 or 6. It doesn't really matter to me, I just need to get out. Harold: I'm available anytime after 5, so that should work for me. Xander: sweet! I'll work on getting all of my equipment together. Quincy: *shudders to himself* ketchup...mustard...oven-hot franks.... (Quincy begins to relive his terrifying experience via monologue and flashback. I see the snow, whiter than titanium dioxide Glinting with a maniacal joy at the prospect of yet another victim I feel myself moving faster and faster, headlong down the hill I cannot stop Any faster and it seems I will time travel And that's when I see it: the hot dog stand It is small, no more than a cart, but at this speed everything looks dangerous I try to steer away, but the snow rips the poles from my hands And my oversized skis pull me wherever the snow dips down My path is taking me straight to the stand There is nothing I can do, so I just scream at the hot dog man to get out of the way Seeing me, he yelps and dives to the side in the nick of time And then....CRASH!!!!! My vision is filled with the explosion of white snow, red ketchup, yellow mustard, and green pickles And then the blackness takes me When I come to, I am in a pile of franks and all manner of condiments The stand itself is nowhere to be seen. Either rolled away or was vaporized by the impact,  I figure At least I'm alive. And these hot dogs are warm. I knew I should've gone bowling today instead Fortunately, no bones were broken due to the cushioning provided by the snow However, some bruises were obtained But I count myself lucky Though, truth be told, I don't really want to go skiing again anytime soon I suppose that's life for you... Harold: wow, you've got quite the memory, man! Quincy: oh no! You heard that whole thing? How? It was just in my head! Harold: c'mon, man! You know I'm a mind reader! Quincy: yeah, actually NO, I didn't know that! Harold: you do now! Quincy: haha. Very funny. You shall never speak of this. Harold: I cam agree to that, but there's really no need. Xander heard the whole thing too. Quincy: WHAAAT???? Xander: hey, uh, yeah, sorry about that.... Quincy: I can't believe you guys have been spying on me this whole time. Xander: don't take it so personally, we're just bored. Nothing else to do. Quincy: well, if its cheap entertainment you want, I guess you came to the right place Harold: that's the spirit! I knew we could count on you :) Xander: I agree. Thank goodness we're all part of the triumvirate Quincy: the, uh, what now? Xander: you know, like in ancient Rome! There were three people with an equal  amount of power Harold: and they tried to share it with each other? Xander: exactly, except it didn't work so well. People are just so greedy, they tried taking each other out. And not to dinner.... Quincy: wait...so then what does that mean for us? If we ARE the triumvirate? Xander: hehehehe Harold: hehehehe Quincy: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (Thus concludes the tale of the ill-fated modern triumvirate. Tune in next week to learn about the tactics of the fearsome sea snake)",

On the other hand, Starship/Superheavy is being produced in semi-open tents. Is SpaceX using different manufacturing techniques that make it more tolerant of environmental contamination compared to say SLS or Starliner? \n\nI envision all sorts of things getting into the Starbase tents - moisture, dust, bugs and even hair and such from technicians who aren't in cleanroom garb. I also imagine that temperature and humidity fluctuate a lot in the tents.  (The video from Tim Dodd's tour of Starbase shows that the interior of the tents is extremely clean, but still...) \n\nThere are things that definitely do require a cleaner manufacturing environment. I'm thinking probably the Raptors, as well as very high value scientific craft such as Perserverence (which had to be completely sterile) and James Webb. Has SpaceX just done their SpaceX-y thing and figured out what they can do under more normal factory conditions? I can also imagine that Boeing etc. are just following expensive legacy techniques that are no longer necessary. That's a good point, what happens if bugs get inside the tanks?

Yet, their initial choice for standard-bearer, 79 year old former President Lyman Trumbull, refused to seek a third term, with the famously cold septuagenarian breaking into tears as he cited his desire to accompany his two dying children in their final moments. Their second choice, Clay Senator Richard F. Pettigrew, has organized the campaign heavily yet refused to stand as a candidate, likely seeing 1892 as a Federal Republican year. Thus, several candidates have entered the field against George. \n\n**Henry George:** 53 year old incumbent President Henry George has not moved a finger to aid his re-election bid, with many suspecting that he despises the office of the presidency and would be content with failure. Despite this, George allies and single-taxers have worked to build a re-election campaign for the president. George\u2019s supporters herald the economic tranquility of his term and focus on the ideal that has carried him thus far, a 100% tax upon the value of land and other natural resources coupled with the abolition of all other taxation, yet also focus on his other views such as intellectual property reform or a \u201ccitizen\u2019s dividend\u201d to every American. They praise George\u2019s lack of action in seeking re-election and paint him as a disinterested hero of the people, hoisted into office against his will yet content with uplifting the masses.\n\n**James B. Weaver:** 59 year old Iowa Governor James B. Weaver has played a major role in Laborite politics since the Bidwell era and has become the leading anti-George candidate. Weaver supported George loyally in 1888 and has not wavered from the party, and thus was reluctant to challenge the President, yet a national movement for him has convinced him to enter the field as a declared candidate for the presidency. Weaver has supported the land value tax but has opposed the idea of it as a single-tax, arguing for the maintenance of the income tax and tariffs, though he supports a further reduction in tariffs. He is a supporter of a cap on inherited wealth, the continuance of prohibition, and supports returning to the Trumbull-era policy of monopoly nationalization rather than simply stringent antitrust measures. Weaver supports civil rights in general but opposes the voter protections present in the Reed-Featherstone Bill. Weaver has campaigned in the Midwest but left campaigning elsewhere to surrogates. \n\n**Thomas E. Watson:** Following the departure of Horace Greeley and his *New York Tribune* for the Laborite fold, the nation\u2019s largest party was left without a coherent base of support within the press. To fill the growing void entered young Thomas E. Watson of Georgia, whose weekly *Watson\u2019s Magazine* has become the voice of the farmers within Farmer-Labor. *Watson\u2019s Magazine* led the charge against Henry George throughout 1888, denouncing him vociferously and endorsing Bidwell, stating that \u201ca true populist cannot see any justice in taking the value out of the land of the farmer while billions in stocks and bonds go untaxed.\u201d Now the 36 year old Georgia Senator has taken to a national tour, traveling thousands of miles throughout agricultural areas to campaign for the primaries and build support going into the convention, campaigning strongly against the single tax, for prohibition, for an income tax, for nationalizing monopolies, and for a cap on inherited wealth. Watson is not a racist and has campaigned against lynching, yet is unclear on the Reed-Featherstone Bill.  \n\n**Terence V. Powderly:** The former President of the General Trades Union, President George\u2019s first Secretary of the Treasury, and one of the key actors in the nomination of George at the 1888 convention, 43 year old Terence V. Powderly of Pennsylvania broke decisively with the president on the issue of tariffs, which Powderly strongly supports. Powderly\u2019s role as one of the leading figures in the labor movement in addition to his moderation overall, opposing most strikes and once supporting the gold standard, along with his friendship with George and support of a land value tax has led him to win a broad base of support. Powderly supports prohibition, civil rights legislation, expansion, and the income tax. Despite his support of civil rights, he has stated that, \u201cit is the industrial, not the race question, I endeavor to solve.\u201d Powderly\u2019s campaign has largely consisted of utilizing the organization of the General Trades Union, focusing on the industrial Northeast, but he has engaged in some personal campaigning. \n\n**James H. Kyle:** Noted for his determination in work and independent demeanor, 38 year old Clay Senator James H. Kyle is a priest by profession and has taken to the campaign trail nationally with the support of General Adelbert Ames, yet is known as a quiet man, and a scholarly rather than passionate speaker. The sole Farmer-Labor Senator to vote against the Chinese Exclusion Act, Kyle is also a strong proponent of military and territorial expansion, denouncing George\u2019s refusal to expand the Navy and unwillingness to work towards annexing Hawaii. Kyle is a moderate opponent of protectionism and a supporter of civil rights legislation.\n\n**Simon Wing:** 66 year old Massachusetts Representative, professional photographer, and camera inventor Simon Wing first involved himself in Labor politics as a 24 year old Workingman\u2019s candidate for State Assembly in 1850, and has come to lead the Massachusetts Farmer-Labor Party following the death of Wendell Phillips and departure of Nathaniel P. Banks and Benjamin Butler. Under Wing\u2019s leadership, the Massachusetts\u2019 party has become the first in the nation to openly declare itself as \u201csocialist,\u201d with Wing coming to lead the party\u2019s socialist wing nationally despite losing several gubernatorial elections upon such a platform. Wing has primarily campaigned on the sweeping ideals of the socialism of editor Daniel De Leon rather than specific policy, though has suggested abolishing the office of the presidency and otherwise stood with Laborite policy suggestions such as nationalizing monopolies and capping inherited wealth, while also calling for the incorporation of unions into government and strongly opposing expansionism. Wing\u2019s campaign has primarily acted as a political statement more than one aimed at victory, yet has functioned thoroughly in calling for the party to pivot towards socialism and promoting Daniel De Leon\u2019s *The Weekly People* as a party newspaper. Wing\u2019s campaign for the presidency has focused on the Northeast yet also courted the support of Richard F. Pettigrew. \n\n\n\n[Elections of 1888](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/pp28wz/enthusiasm_and_questionable_tactics_from_both/) \n\n[Midterms of 1890](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/pqngo2/winning_their_first_ever_popular_vote_majority/) \n\n[A Summary of President Henry George\u2019s Term](https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidentialpoll/comments/preoyp/a_summary_of_president_henry_georges_term/) \n\n[Complete Link Compendium](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peacock-Shah/comments/n1l4ba/peacockshah_alternate_elections_link_compendium/)\n\n[Map](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peacock-Shah/comments/p66zyu/map_of_the_united_states_in_peacockshah_alternate/)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ps5m9t) Will the Federal Republicans be adopting the primary system if it becomes popular?",

            "text": "I've been feeling some major cognitive dissonance coming to grips with the apparent reality of alien technology if not alien life on our planet. I know many people in this sub won't agree, but I think it's important to talk about this from all points of view, especially if a major disclosure event is going to occur. Long-time enthusiasts need to understand the point of view of people just stumbling into this now. If something big drops we need to be prepared to help everyone cope with this new reality. I'd like to offer my perspective as somebody who only recently stumbled into all this as a result of the ongoing \"soft disclosure\".\n\nHearing government officials more or less confirm alien technology on our planet has been one of the most exciting things I've ever experienced. I've always dismissed UFO stories, thinking that maybe we've been contacted a time or two but not believing it could be kept secret for this long, so I mostly dismissed the possibility. I hate to say it but this Senate report has really changed things for me. Don't get me wrong, I don't trust our elected officials but I can't imagine why they'd be lying about this... Hearing regular old local news anchors awkwardly (but with a straight face!) talking about UFOs and extraterrestrial life has been such a surreal, beginning-of-a-Hollywood movie experience.\n\nIn the past I've felt confused when considering the Fermi Paradox, it just didn't make sense that we hadn't discovered other life out in the cosmos. Some of the possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox were just barely palatable enough to satisfy my curiosity, so I didn't think too much about it. I figured our technology would eventually get advanced enough (James Webb!) to detect other life (maybe just primitive, basic life, not intelligent) and we would get some cool new Veritasium and SpaceTime videos on the matter and that would be it.\n\nWhat's happening now is much different than that and it really does make us look like cavemen. The spacetime warping stuff is especially unsettling. I thought that if we found other intelligent life it would at least play by the same laws of physics as us (lack of a Grand Unified Theory notwithstanding). I drastically underestimated the holes in our understanding and the practical applicability of quantum theories. It's very unsettling to imagine any intelligent entity (human or otherwise) being able to PAUSE TIME and move around physical space with apparent impunity. The Simulation Hypothesis seems all but certain. I don't know how to feel about any of that.\n\nI'm simultaneously thrilled and apprehensive. Not me",

            "text": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.\n\nFor solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).\n\nFor cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.\n\nNow in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer. \n\nLast but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.\n\nIn the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.\n\nSYL So what about car\u2019s alternator? Also thank you for the detailed explanation",

He was from a little town of Atarib near Aleppo, Syria. He was a former member of the Free Syrian Army's (rebel) division called Suwar Al-Sham.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights, 134 Syrians were identified dead (locals say 185). 13 died in the past two days. They were all recruited by Turkish citizens.\n\nSome militants have already asked Turkey to send them back while agreeing to forfeit the salary.\n\nThe precise number of Syrians in Karabakh is hard to tell, but the initial reports indicated around 1,000. The main recruitment was in the first days, and it slowed down later once the nature of the war became apparent. \n\nThe militants were recruited in Idlib, Syria and southern Turkey by commanders Mustafa Seyjar (FSA), Abu Amsha (Suleiman Shah), Saif Abu Bakir (Hamza), etc.\n\nInstead of the $77/mo (600 Turkish Lira) that they were being paid to fight against the Syrian government, they were offered a lucrative $1,800/mo to fight in Karabakh. The life insurance is $30,000 in the event they're killed.\n\nIn either case, the militant and his family are promised Turkish citizenship. This has attracted many. \n\nFull: https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2020/10/23/87657-1800-dollarov-za-karabah\n\nhttps://armenpress.am/arm/news/1032561.html\n \n\n\n##airstrike in northern Syria\n\nIn other news.

Besides the activities in the front lines, throughout the day, they bombed Artsakh's civilian settlements. That's what they do after failures on the battlefield.\n\nThe battles were fierce in the south of the center, near Shekher and Jivanik villages, as we already reported yesterday. There were successes in neutralizing the infiltrator groups. Village Shekher and its nearby forests are almost completely cleared of infiltrators. Some groups still remain in nearby forests; they're being neutralized.\n\nIn the south, all day long Azeris tried to attack near Vorotan (Qubadli?). Several attacks failed and after sustaining heavy losses, they were thrown back. Some units were completely dismantled. After losing armored vehicles they began to flee and hide in nearby valleys and forests. \n\nIn the south, on the river valley that stretches towards the Lachin corridor, near Hakari village (south of Lachin), the Azeris were pushed back further south after we attacked.\n\nOverall the situation is tense. The battles are localized. There are no clear frontlines. Azeris try to attack near various river valleys and settlements, which are being neutralized by us.\n\nThat is the real situation we have today. Some of you may read reports about battles near a certain location and get the wrong impression that the situation is dire. But that's not how it works. \n\nOur army is in full control of the situation, and despite the fact that Azeris moved forward in some areas, our army deals heavy blows on them.\n\n*Q: will you publish a map of the current battlefield?*\n\nA: yes, tomorrow we will publish the map of battles. We are aware of a map published by Ukrainian bloggers that does not accurately portray the situation *[is he referring to Livemap Caucasus?]*.  The problem with maps is that people interpret them as solid \"lines\" and specific movements. But since the battles are now more localized (with infiltrators), maps will not accurately portray the situation, although we will present our own map.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7Bv49y0DrhQ\n\n\n\n\n##COVID stats\n \n+5,760 tested. +2,474 infected. +14 deaths. +489 healed. 21,560 active.\n\n471 patients across Armenia are waiting for a free bed.

O'Toole has failed to make any progress whatsoever, and for a party specifically designed to contest for power, that's really, *really* not good. I don't think there's an argument for him being given a second chance other than 'tradition'.   \n\n\nAs for Jagmeet Singh, I can't think of a single rational or logical reason for the NDP to keep him. The party's performances in its target seats were strikingly poor across the country, the loss of several open seats must count as actively alarming, and there's no sign of new voters being brought to the table anywhere.\n\nTruly amazing. I agree with most of this, but Jagmeet Singh is still an incredibly popular figure, especially among young people, and I don't know that replacing him would solve much right now. \n\nBut the NDP's performance as a whole was definitely a loss. Projected at times to get a dozen new seats, and they got just a single more. The Liberals obviously fucked up, the Conservatives had a real chance for power and fell on their face at the very last minute, the PPC while increasing their vote share couldn't even win their leader's own seat, and the Greens and BQ made no ground whatsoever. \n\nNothing of significance has changed at all and the parliamentary status quo is exactly as it was before the election. The turnout was one of the very lowest in Canadian history. The choice to have an election in the first place was overwhelmingly unpopular. As always, FPTP fucked up everything it's allowed to contaminate. And EVERYBODY LOST, not a single party really succeeded or benefitted from their involvement in it.

That\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing. Waiting and waiting and waiting.\u201d\n\nMe, already knowing it\u2019s gonna be a long time with her says \u201cI understand ma\u2019am.

This is customer service, I mean it should be better than this\u201d\n\nTo get the process going I said \u201cAre you picking up\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m picking up for me and my husband, I need my blood pressure medication and both of our cholesterol\u201d\n\nTurns out her BP meds and her husband\u2019s cholesterol medication are on hold, so I had to put in a 15 min wait time for her to pick it up.\n\nSo I said to her \u201cMa\u2019am, the only prescription you have available right now is ur cholesterol medication. I see the other ones you need right now so I\u2019m going to put it into the production queue and it can be ready for you in 15 mins\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s like \u201cAm I gonna have to wait again?\u201d\n\nI say \u201cIf you are going through the drive through and there are covid tests, yes it might take some time. If you come into the store though, there are no covid tests there so you won\u2019t have to wait as long\u201d\n\nShe replies with \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to wait again. Are you going to call me when my prescription is ready\u201d\n\nme: \u201cI have you listed here as someone who receives text messages when your prescription is ready, so you will get a text\u201d\n\nher: I want my husband\u2019s prescription texted to me too.\n\nI change the contact method and then I go get her prescription that is ready. Then she announces she has goodRX. As she\u2019s showing me the code to put in, her phone screen dims and I have to tell her to tap it. She opens her mouth again and says, \u201cSee, you took too long\u201d\n\nI tell her her meds will be more expensive with goodRX. She finally buys her medication.\n\nShe opens her mouth again \u201ccan you call me when my prescription is ready. can you CALL me to tell me the copay\u201d\n\nI said \u201cYou\u2019ll get a text when it\u2019s ready. If you want to know the copay you can call the store and ask so we can look up your profile and tell you.\u201d\n\nShe opens her mouth again \u201cThat means when I pick it up, I am still going to have to wait\u201d\n\nI am literally fed up with her shit so I tell her \u201cNo matter where you go you are going to have to wait ma\u2019am. You have been here for 20 minutes and I an really trying to get this drive thru going. There are people behind you also waiting. And I an trying my best here\u201d \n\nShe finally is like \u201cokay I\u2019ll get a text and then i\u2019ll wait again\u201d\n\nThank you Jesus,Joseph and Mary, she FINALLY LEAVES.

            "text": "Hello everyone. I'm in a pickle. My mother, instead of parent plus, took out a Wells Fargo private student loan my sophomore year. I just got the first statement today.\nApparently I have a 11.8% interest rate, the interest already racked up $5k, and they want me to pay $10.5k on that loan alone this year. Along with that, they estimate my total payments would amount to around $47k.\nI'm extremely overwhelmed and I have not the first clue what to do to with this. I have over $130k in student debt total and I want to consolidate them all into one loan with a lower interest rate.\nWhat do I do? Okay let's go 2 steps back: you should go to the Annual Credit Report site and pull your free regulatory credit report disclosure from all 3 credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and Transunion). Link is in the side bar and here https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action this will help you piece together what debts exist in your name, just in case your mom did some other shady things like signing you up for credit cards\n\nI'd also suggest logging in to the FSA Dashboard to get an overview of your federal loan debts https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing\n\nFrom there, put everything out on a spreadsheet. Generally speaking you *do not* want to refinance your federal loans as that makes them private student loans, so you waive all the federal perks of flexible deferment, forbearance, income-driven repayment, and forgiveness (TEPSLF/PSLF, TLF, TPD, BD, etc) options. Depending on your post-grad salary you may need to use an IDR plan to keep your federal loan payment manageable while you tackle your private student loans\n\nFor private student loans, if you do not want to go the legal/identity theft route (which would be burning a bridge with your mom for sure) then you'll likely want to refinance every 12-18 months to chase lower interest rates on those loans while repaying them as quickly as you can",

Looking back, these conditions were likely indicative of my parents\u2019 financial insecurities \u2013 particularly one parent\u2019s traumatic background \u2013 and the desire for me to be economically self-sufficient through \u201ctough love.\u201d As I have grown older, my own approach is more of a \u201ctalk openly, speak often\u201d about financial matters with the people that I am close with \u2013 I feel that everyone benefits from the transparency. \n\n**Retirement Balance (and how you got there)**\n\nAt the start of this diary my retirement balance was \\~$36k. I did not start saving for retirement before 28 and always shrugged it off with a cavalier comment about dying before retirement age. When I started working at my company (at 28),  I put the bare minimum into anything retirement to focus on paying off private debts. Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I had \\~$6-7k in my 401k from 2+ years of work (but no more private debt!).\n\nIn 2020, I decided to change my approach:\n\n* Raised my 401k contributions (not much but still a lot to me at \\~8%)\n* Opened and worked to max out my Roth IRA (RIRA)\n* Opened an HSA, and later tried to max it out before the 2020 deadline\n\nIn 2021, I continued approach refinement efforts:\n\n*  Raised my 401k contribution level again\n   * Set my 401k so that 55% of any potential bonus would automatically go to \u201cSchwabby boy\u201d (What I call my collective Charles Schwab Roth 401k accounts)\n* Opened a Roth 401k and started small contributions\n* Continued to max out the HSA\n* Planned to max out Roth IRA\n\n**Equity if you're a homeowner (and how much you put down and how you accumulated that payment)**\n\nHahahahaha, ZERO BABY. \n\nAm I the only one whose desire for home ownership stems from wanting to provide a place for the pets? If they are not part of the picture, my \u201chome goals\u201d will probably change. Also, I feel like money would go further in other locales than the east-coast big city suburbs\u2026 and I haven\u2019t let go of the dream of owning a century-old house. \n\n**Credit card debt (and how you accumulated it)**\n\nPaid in full at the end of each month. \n\n**Student loan debt (for what degree)**\n\nMy undergraduate degrees in social sciences were fully paid for by scholarships. Family helped pay two years of dorm fees, and I worked to pay for food + everything else during that time and housing plus everything beyond that time. \n\nGraduate studies in a humanities and professional degree ended up costing \\~$60k over several years, despite most of my time being covered with work study and qualified tuition reimbursement. Those experiences sparked a vast amount of thoughts and feelings about the affordability of graduate education and how we treat students, but I will keep the soap box in the corner. \ud83d\ude0a \n\n**IF YOU COMBINE FINANCES WITH A S/O PLEASE INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR ASSETS / DEBT AS WELL**\n\nI live with my long-term boyfriend, M. We do not technically share accounts but have decent visibility into each other\u2019s finances.  \n\nTechnically, the one asset we share is M.\u2019s car, which is paid off and which I have on my insurance. \n\nI did have a paid off car that ended up rehomed to a friend for a couple dollars last year. It did not make sense to pay $100/mo for a parking space for both cars when we weren\u2019t using my older, slightly busted hand-me-down from my grandparents. It was an awesome opportunity to save money, help an AMAZING person, and pay forward a fraction of the kindness/generosity/privilege I have been given. Also, the peace of mind knowing that someone is looking after \u201cgoldie\u201d and accepts her quirks and isn\u2019t condemning her to a junkyard is quite soothing. \n\n**Section Two: Income Progression:**\n\n**I\u2019ve been working in my career for 3.5 years and my starting salary was $72,500.** \n\n**Year 1 (2018) \u2013 Raise to $75,000**\n\n**Year 2**  **(2019) \u2013**  **Promotion and raise to $84,500**\n\n**Year 3 (2020)**  **\u2013 COVID \u2013 no raise**\n\n**Year 4 \u2013 at the end of this year I will receive another raise to \\~$92,000.** \n\n*Have you changed careers? Did you recently have a breakthrough in your career? Here is where you can tell us about your salary/job progression.*\n\nI have been working since I was 13 at various jobs. After undergrad, I wanted to travel and build my language skills, so I opted to teach English abroad (in a place that did not pay super well). I was still happy and managed to save to be able to travel after my contract ended. I survived several years in grad school making \\~$13k/year + tuition remission + healthcare benefits. My grad school years were a bit of a financial undoing as I took on more debt. It is unsettling to recognize that I was more financially stable for a while at 22 than I was at 27-30 \u2013 thanks, old me and grad school. \n\nAs grad school was wrapping up, the financial insecurity was suffocating. The student debt always felt like this looming \u2013 glooming \u2013 dooming presence that encumbered my ability to autonomously live my own life. So, I tried to be financially sensible \u2013 stifled other ambitions to secure a decent-paying job with some semblance of economic security. And suddenly, surprisingly, I was a consultant.  \n\n**Main Job Monthly Take Home: $4300** \n\n**Side Gig Monthly Take Home: $0**\n\n**Any Other Monthly Income Here: $0**\n\n**Section Three: Expenses**\n\n**Rent:** $2700/mo  - I pay \\~$1200 and M pays $1500 \n\nHe contributes more as he gets paid a bit more and this allows me to pay down my student loans. \n\n**Renters / home insurance:** M. pays\n\n**Retirement contribution:** This is in flux right now \u2013 I have been rebuilding my emergency fund from maxing out funds by the 2020 deadline and paying off one student loan, but would usually budget $250/pay period\n\n**Savings contribution:** $500 / paycheck ($1k/mo.)\n\n**Debt payments:** \n\nStudent loans \u2013 current balance: $43, 850. I pay $500-$700/mo. Yes, student loans are in forbearance, but I have been paying incrementally to lower my debt-to-income ratio and show payments on the principal \u2013 which have helped me raise my credit score. \n\n**Donations (please specify if monthly or annual).** We annually donate \\~$200 each to various social movement organizations. Volunteering is something I have previously enjoyed and hope to ease back into. \n\n**Electric/Gas/water \u2013** We paid our utilities upfront for six months and have money set aside to pay for another six months in winter\n\n**Wifi/Cable/Landline \u2013** M. pays\n\n**Cellphone \u2013** prepaid \\~$1800\n\n**Subscriptions** \u2013 I pay $100 annually for our Amazon Prime and M. pays for Spotify and Disney+ (He HAD TO see Mandalorian) we are on his family plans for other streaming apps. I also pay bi-monthly for Ipsy ($18).\n\n**Gym membership** \\- $0  \n\n**Pet expenses** \u2013  \\~$125/mo unless we are going to the vet. M and I split this cost\n\n**Car payment / insurance** \\- $75/mo. \n\n**Regular therapy** \\- $100/mo.\n\n**Paid hobbies** \u2013 language lessons $50/mo, will also begin fitness classes next month which will add to this budget (SO EXCITED!)\n\n**Any other expense that's relevant to you** \u2013 do investments in fermentation gear count? If so, I\u2019ve made at least $250 worth of jarred goods to become a kombucha/ginger beer/fermentation general brew master. (Results have differed from my expectations.) \n\nOh! I should count book club \u2013 probably \\~40/mo. on books. Yes, I joined a local library \u2013 and no it hasn\u2019t helped as the borrowed books simply float on the surface of my collection.  \n\n**Day One \u2013 (Friday)**\n\n7:00am \u2013 wake up and launch morning routine. Take pup for a walk, get dragged around the neighborhood on a squirrel-hunting quest, come back and release the two beasties in the garden. Keep a careful eye on the garden and beasties while trying to make coffee. M. has been away this past week to visit family and I have unwittingly expended all shreds of pet parental credibility in his absence\u2026 These animals survived YEARS without him, but suddenly one week and our surly 17lb nine year old cat, El Chonko, is facing a fox in the garden and Wonderpup manages to breach the fence and take himself on a neighborhood tour before trying to climb a tree in pursuit of squirrels. Well not today, boys. I turn on the kettle and pop outside to spend time in the garden with the pets.\n\nCoffee made, animals inside, animals fed \u2013 and a quick morning yoga routine. \n\n8:00am \u2013 Log onto my company and client computers, perform basic administrative tasks. I usually review my own JIRA board and write a prioritized to-do list to start the day. Today appears to be emails, training, and a few deliverables. \n\n10am \u2013 12pm \u2013 I am in a training for new tech that the client is thinking of acquiring. Our team is working with various stakeholders to assess the capabilities to determine whether what the company offers is worth the price tag. Today is the first day of our two-week trial.\n\n12pm \u2013 1pm \u2013 review some of the model technicalities behind one of the pilot programs being developed for our team. I try to keep it light-hearted with Friday the 13th joke to break the ice with our cross-functional team, especially since we don\u2019t all work together regularly. \n\n1:15pm \u2013 With the discussion over I grab a peanut butter and jelly. My standing 1pm was cancelled, but I have a client pinging me. \n\n1:45pm \u2013 3:00pm \u2013 Hop on an impromptu call with clients to develop a strategy on some action items for which we are accountable\n\n4:30pm \u2013 I am tired, there still seem to be more deliverables but I call it a day. Time to take Wonderpup to the park before it rains. He is AMPED. \n\n5:30pm \u2013 Not many dogs at the park, so we come back and play fetch in the backyard. \n\n6:15pm \u2013 I take some tomatoes from the garden and decide to make a Chinese dish of fried egg and tomato. The recipe I\u2019m looking at doesn\u2019t call for Shaoxing cooking wine, but I\u2019m greedy \u2013 and no regrets. Our kitchen is one of those perpetually messy spaces that is just a happy place. However, there is a real need to watch out for a lurking 17-lb \u201ckitten\u201d and 100-lb dog who think the kitchen is the perfect space to be underfoot. \n\n7:30pm \u2013 I spend the evening watching a Youtube video about sewing vintage designs and then push through a few pages of the current pick for book club. We deviated from normal socio-political discourses for a book that talks about the history of cocktails and how to make drinks**.** \n\n**Day Two \u2013 (Saturday)**\n\n9am \u2013 wake up and get escorted down the stairs by el chonko and Wonderpup. Another garden morning and then I hustle everyone inside, feed the kitten, chug some caffeine, and get the pup ready for the dog park. \n\nWonderpup spends an hour playing with other pups, including his absolute favorite friend, at the park. We head home for a late breakfast and then I start cleaning.\n\n11:00am \u2013 4:00pm That\u2019s it. I\u2019m cleaning for several hours today. However, a quality opportunity to get some episodes of the \u201cYou\u2019re Wrong About\u201d podcast. \n\nM.\u2019s returning this afternoon and taking an Uber to the house \u2013 I\u2019m trying to get the place deep cleaned since his mom is going to be visiting us in two weeks. \n\n4:00pm \u2013 M.\u2019s home! We spend time snuggling and catching up. Eventually, we both take a nap. \n\n8:00pm \u2013 I suggest we order food for pickup and that we can try this new Afghan restaurant M. has been eyeing \u2013 my treat. (I spent the week coasting from our previous week\u2019s groceries, and we expect to get a bonus on Friday, so there\u2019s room in the budget.) $55 for two. While waiting on our order, we pop over to the liquor store to stock ingredients for our bar in anticipation for new recipes I am making for book club \u2013 I also get some stuff in anticipation for M.\u2019s mom\u2019s visit: $135\n\n***Total: $190***\n\n**Day Three \u2013 (Sunday)**\n\n9:30am \u2013 whoops, our Instacart order that we placed last night is already here. $96, M pays because I got last time. \n\n10:0 0am \u2013 More of the lazy morning with the animals followed by time at the dog park. While there, we decided to visit World Market on a quest for raspberry syrup since one of the recipes calls for syrup. \n\n11:30am \u2013 we are at World Market. We haven\u2019t been to one since 2019! I want to look at EVERYTHING. We end up grabbing some coffee, stock up on ChemEx filters, grab two types of syrup,  AND M. finds a gorgeous runner (well done, M!) that might be easier for the animals as they dart through our hallways of wooden floors. Total \\~$220. M pays. \n\nLunch \u2013 leftovers from Afghan dinner (yum!). I spend the afternoon reading, M. works on some of his projects, and then I hop on a family call. My family seems a bit subdued and disengaged, so after the call I look up some virtual activities that we can do. There\u2019s a puzzle/mystery box that looks like it could be fun for my grandmother (who I think the nature of the pandemic has been discouraging) and the rest of the family. I ask my parents for addresses and go ahead and sign up for five boxes. $130. I hope this works. \n\n8:30pm \u2013 Prepare to make drinks for book club \u2013 slightly discouraging as I realize I am not a fan of several of the recently procured liquors\u2026 Well, a lesson to be learned about taste and bar ambiance. \n\n9:00pm \u2013 Book club discussion with my friends for 1.5 hours while M. games with a friend. Then off to bed. \n\n***Total: $450, but I pay $130***\n\n**Day Four \u2013 (Monday)** \n\n7:45am \u2013 We are up late because the neighbors\u2019 dogs started barking at 2am. I doom scroll Reddit before dragging myself out of bed for a day chalked with meetings. \n\n9:00am \u2013 Standup meeting with another tech team where I am responsible for highlighting due diligence issues. I repeat the status of certain efforts and stress recommendations I have been echoing for a few weeks now. The inertia is grating and I loathe being a parrot who can do nothing else but repeat herself regarding project risks and active mitigation measures. \n\nI start testing some scenarios in one of the new tools to see how useful it is in solving a due diligence problem. I also begin to design one of the large stakeholder briefings that will need to explain where our team is with technical work to non-technical stakeholders.\n\n11am \u2013 3pm are back-to-back client meetings for another team. More technical discussions and evaluations. \n\nM. makes a pb&amp;j and sneaks me refills on water, coffee, and tea when he is available and I\u2019m still in meetings. By 4:30pm, I have run out of steam and call it a day. \n\n6:00pm \u2013 M and I cook steak and asparagus, have dinner together and talk about our days.\n\n7:30pm \u2013 Watch two episodes of Silicon valley and talk about our days\n\nBrowse phone before bed.\n\n**Day Four \u2013 (Tuesday)** \n\n6:45am \u2013 wake up and we are still dragging a bit. The weather is overcast and gloomy so we quickly toss the animals into the garden before it starts raining. Grab a bowl of kashi cereal and take my caffeine to the office to hunker down.\n\nI start working on testing, training, and \u201cadministrative stuff.\u201d   \n\nClient meetings straight from 9am \u2013 2pm. \n\n3:15pm Receive an ad-hoc call by clients requesting whether I could make executive slides briefing out innovation efforts that demonstrates the impacts our cross-functional teams have had with their evaluations. Absolutely!\n\nWork on slides while waiting to hear from my DEV Team so I can prepare for a Sprint Review. By 4:30pm, I realize that this is the only chance for a break in the rain to take Wonderpup to the dog park. M. gets everything ready, and away we go. \n\nWe hodge-podge dinner, and I am back online working by 7:30pm on two different presentations. I\u2019ve been striving to set better work boundaries with myself, so I send what needs to be done by 9:00am and let the other work go for now.\n\n9:30pm \u2013 Evening face care \u201croutine\u201d. Routine might be too generous a descriptor here, as I tend to do these steps for a few days in a row and then stop on days where I\u2019m extra sleepy. \n\n10:00pm \u2013 Read through Reddit while \n\n**Day Five \u2013 (Wednesday)**\n\nI forgot to do a diary on this day. (I know! But no money spent!)\n\n**Day Six \u2013 (Thursday)**\n\n7:45am \u2013 Morningtime with the boys. Spend it being a bit silly and singing some songs. M. is nervous today because he has an interview for a new job. \n\n8:30 am \u2013 This week I have been eating like I am 10. I take my pb&amp;j, coffee, and head to my office. Begin work with to-do list and administrative tasks\n\n10am \u2013 I get to surprise M.! I had arranged for a custom detailer to come to the house and thoroughly fix-up the car. This is something M. had mentioned he\u2019d been interested in, especially with his mom visiting. Wonderpup has staked his claim on the backseat and most of the interior through sheer fur and expansion capability. \n\nI meet the technician who is great and we chat a bit before I run to a day chalked full of meetings. Our technician works on the care for \\~5 hours. *Total: $225 detail + $50 pet hair removal + $60 cash tip = $335*\n\nI\u2019m in meetings from 10:30am \u2013 4:15pm with clients about various tools and technologies. Then wrap up some slides that I\u2019m pulling together for a client. I have to finally stop and go watch a Victorian Restoration video on Youtube because I am out of gas. \n\n6:00pm \u2013 Catch up with one of my old friends. I am thrilled to hear about how he and his wife are doing, and they invite me to come see them at their new place. We chat about some opportunities to learn more about and get involved in folk art. We have a brainstormed list worth exploring and make noncommittal plans to get back in touch soon. Hearing from the two of them has warmed my burnout heart. \n\n8:00pm \u2013 Time for my weekly language lessons! I spent so long studying and pursuing language throughout my university studies and it is frustrating to see it slip. During the pandemic, I was able to reach out to an old teacher abroad, and we have weekly lessons that are \u2026 humbling. I enjoy seeing her, but I always have a tinge of guilt that I\u2019m not studying more or doing more homework throughout the week. However, I am always \u201con\u201d so that by the time the evening hits I feel like my brain has been sitting in a sous vide. Still, one day the world will reopen \\[more\\] with travel and the ability to clumsily practice my languages beyond a small comfort zone.  \n (Truly, El chonko and Wonderpup are my daily language partners\u2026. My teacher thought it was funny for how I was using a command with the dog. \u201cYou know, with the way you say it, it\u2019s not like a native. Perhaps he knows and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t listen.\u201d Thanks, Teach.) \n\n9:15pm \u2013 I try to call my grandmother who called during the language lesson. She ghosts me. Still no callback. Damn, Grams, that\u2019s cold. :D \n\n9:30pm \u2013 Look who manages to slab on some face wash and night oil \u2013 and call it a routine? I expect to be radiant by morning! \n\n10:00pm \u2013 Settle in to read a new leisurely book. M. asks if it\u2019s one of the book club books, or one of the other books I\u2019ve been saying I would read. No, M, now let me read bits and pieces of multiple books in peace.\n\n***Total: $335***\n\n**Day Seven \u2013 (Friday)**\n\n6:30am \u2013 This has been a dismal week regarding our ability to getup and go. However, this one is squarely on me. I woke up on from my sleep shouting, \u201cNOOOOO!\u201d at \\~2:30am as unconscious me remembered something waking Mara did not. Poor M, my franticness got him too. By 3:30am I was getting twitchy thinking about my to-do list and thought about just getting up and starting my day. I then decided to try a relaxation technique and managed to knock myself out before I could be productive. \n\n6:50am \u2013 Another alarm, whoops. There\u2019s too much keeping me in bed this morning so I crank on some Spotify and catapult forward. Wash my face, which, is surprisingly glow-y for someone with little sleep.  (Night routine coming through!)\n\n7:00am \u2013 Stumble through the morning chores while the animals are carousing in the yard. I check my bank account because THE BIG DAY IS HERE! \n\nThat number looks a bit smaller than I was expecting, but maybe I underestimated withholding. (Bonus breakdown forthcoming)\n\nI eat several bowls of Kashi vanilla cereal knowing that today will be another meeting-heavy schedule. Animals are inside and fed. Time to work.\n\n7:45am \u2013 4:00pm \u2013 A combination of administrative work and meetings. When there is a few minutes pause, I grab water or take a bio break and watch clips of a Youtube restoration video on a Victorian house. The video has its own creativity that resonates with something in me and I use that energy to carry me through the rest of the day. \n\n4:00pm \u2013 Sign off and talk to M. Big news, he has a job offer. There\u2019s so much for him to think about and some decisions he is going to need to make in the next few days. We call his mom and he shares the fun news. Then we take a nap. It\u2019s been a long week short on sleep. \n\n6:00pm \u2013 We go outside and play with Wonderdog in the yard and pick some peppers and squash from the garden. \n\n7:00pm \u2013 We cook dinner together, crack some jokes in the kitchen, and talk about our days at the table. We wrap up by watching three episodes of Silicon Valley before M. heads to bed and I finish my MD. \n\n**Tally up all expenses in the following categories:**\n\n**Food + Drink:** $190 my portion or $285 both\n\n**Fun / Entertainment:** $130 (gifts for others)\n\n**Home + Health:** \n\n**Clothes + Beauty:**\n\n**Transport:** $335 (car detail)\n\nOther\n\n**Lastly, reflect on your diary!** \n\n$655 of personal spending -  oof! This was not a normal week because we were getting our bonuses and I did several things for other people knowing that I had that flexibility due to the bonus. In fact, all of my spending appears to be one-off costs (e.g. the gift boxes for family, taking M. out to dinner, getting the car detailed for M., stocking our bar with new alcohol in anticipation for certain events) \u2013 without those, I would be splitting the normal grocery bill + World Market (which again is a one-off) with M.   \n\nI\u2019ve mentioned my bonus, so I wanted to share some details. I received my first bonus from the company, valued at $16k. This is a huge amount of money for me \u2013 it is more than I have made annually for most of my adult life! I know that I would be curious about how others allocate their bonus so I will share mine:\n\nFirst, in anticipation of the bonus I did go a bit \u201cwild\u201d in getting items for myself \u2013 I did this before hand because I keep padding in my checking account that I was able to leverage to treat myself.\n\n*  $420 Tria laser hair device (FDA approved laser that allows me to do laser hair removal at my pace and in the privacy of my own home. Also, still cheaper than normal treatment or Groupons. Initial thoughts \u2013 didn\u2019t appreciate the investment in time and downplayed pain. Still happy with it!)  \n \n* \\~$130 products on sale from Ipsy including shampoo, lip tins, face balm, bath salt, and non-aluminum deodorant (i.e., things that I would use!) \u2013 so far I have enjoyed these items!  \n \n*  \\~$250 Fermentation gear \u2013 I consume a TON of caffeine and thought that I could move towards kombucha/ginger beer/ water kefir to downplay that (again, the time investment is what\u2019s getting me! But so far it has been a WILD ride. El Chonko/kitten has totally been judging my fermentation jars \u2013 one sniff and then he looks at me with some serious concern)\n\nSo I guess this, coupled with the surprise for M., constitutes a large chunk of the spending for the bonus. However, I made these purchases over multiple paychecks, so I was able to (surprisingly!) incorporate the costs of Tria, Ipsy, Fermentation, and detailing into my padded budget.\n\nSo how does the $16k bonus shake out?\n\n* I allocated 52% to 401k and 3% to Roth 401k \n   * Resulted in +$8,320 to 401k and should (Shwabby boy has not yet confirmed) put me to \\~$24k\n* With $7,680 remaining, apparently $3,355 went to taxes. \n   * There is also an odd withholding that I have yet to resolve\n* Which leaves me with \\~$3850 sent to my checking account\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My plan:**\n\n$1250 to savings (gets me to $12k)\n\n$1500 RIRA\n\n$600 student loans\n\n$500 checking account padding If you care, you use your first name on day 7 \ud83d\ude09",

A total of about 60 hours a week. My mom was yelling at me because supposedly I didn\u2019t plan on going back to school, I\u2019d be content with overworking myself and that I\u2019ll end up impregnated by the guy I started dating a month prior (?) and never end up in a better situation. All assumptions and extreme projecting from her. \n\nPaid for community college on my own and she had no plans of helping me for the rest of my undergrad, yet she still criticized me for saving up that money. Told me I needed to do better than minimum wage less than a year before, but somehow doing exactly that was also wrong.\n\nFlash forward two years. Got my two undergrad degrees (!!!) last year, paid out of pocket and graduated with no student debt. Started a grad program at one of the top schools for my area of study. Worked in a better role at my old company, then did two internships at well-known companies. Got a full-time offer for a six-figure job from one of the companies I interned at last week. And this job will pay for 3-4 classes worth every year as one of its benefits. Worked on my mental health and paid for treatment on my own. Still with the same guy in a very healthy relationship who also miraculously landed a six-figure job earlier this year. We were making literally 1/4 of that in 2019. Also happily child-free and we\u2019re moving across the country before 2022.\n\nI\u2019m 23, and I never expected my life to turn out this way in such a short period of time because of my parents constantly belittling me growing up. But I did it! :) Congratulations!  What really sucks is that your Nparents will probably never acknowledge or praise you for any of that.

The growth of renewables cited in this video is real, but the until the global economy is actually carbon neutral the planet will continue to warm.\n\n\nClimate change is a solvable problem. The solutions are clear and achievable. The issue is that the scale of action we have seen so far is not sufficient to keep warming below an acceptable threshold, according to every plausible projection I have seen. Currently we are on track for anywhere between 2 - 3 C of warming, which is catastrophic. \n\n\nHave there been some encouraging signs in the past few years? Sure, we\u2019re beginning to see real action. It\u2019s still not enough, not even close. Every plausible path to real mitigation requires a massive acceleration in decarbonization within the next decade, and I have not seen indications that is likely to occur given recent history. \n\n\nSo overall I find this kind of soft denialism to be very dangerous. People talk a lot about doomerism leading to inaction, but I think the far more prevalent reaction is this kind of hopepunk happy talk where the real seriousness of our situation is obscured. Yeah i feel like this video cherry picked the good that was happening. We are moving in the right direction. Its just that we arent doing it fast enough. \n\nBeing idle certainly wont do anyone any good, go onto the street to protest, engage in discussions and make the people surrounding you aware of what is to come if we dont take action.\n\nThank you for the reply.",

The higher the rent the less you are left with, while those on benefits see little to no differences. It is unsustainable pretty much globally and we need to take control of basic needs as a society.. all of them, housing being one. We need housing solution where EVERYONE has an option for low cost housing and if you want something better: you pay more for it. In other words, private provides luxury, government provides the basics. Only then there is some resemblance of free market.  Absolutely NO basic need can be handled by supply and demand market rules as the demand is 1 unit of housing for EVERY SINGLE PERSON. I can choose to not buy a TV, phone, car etc. I can not choose to not live in a house. Free market can not work in those areas. The food we eat is heavily subsidized and prices controlled. They may look free but there are various methods how to keep food affordable for as many as possible, preferably all.. It is quite rare that anyone dies of hunger in the western world. But we do have homeless. Here in Finland it is treated de facto as a right, you will get some housing and homelessness are split in two parts: those who can't get a home in the area they work in and couch surf, and alcoholists and people with serious mental conditions that can't hold an apartment or won't for some reason. It is not perfect situation, for sure but better than it was a decade ago. This is a dumb rant against \"the free market\". If you think capitalism is to blame for the problem of housing you couldn't be more wrong. High rent and housing prices in North American cities are caused by local government imposed restrictions on the supply of housing, which is politically driven by the outsized influence of local homeowners in local government. In markets where housing supply is unrestrained aka a \"free market\" rent and housing prices approximately reflect the cost of development",

And what i suggested is that we build government housing to solve the problem since thatfree market does not seem to be very keen on changing any policies.\n\nIf you have the political power to do this, it's way more inefficient than just... removing those restrictions. Like a way worse solution. Also you're very wrong. Developers absolutely want to remove these restrictions. It's local citizens that own homes which do not. \n\n&gt;I suppose you can find me an example of free market not having those restrictions?\n\nHouston, Austin, Tokyo. As opposed to NYC, SF, Tokyo, Boston. \n\nI recommend reading [this brief literature review](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2009number2/supply-side-housing-markets#:~:text=High%20prices%20always%20reflect%20the,no%20matter%20what%20the%20demand.) by an economist who specializes in this subject:\n\n&gt;Economists understand that supply, not just demand, is critical to understanding housing markets. High prices always reflect the intersection of strong demand and limited supply. If demand in a market is weak, then prices cannot be high, no matter what the supply. And, if supply is unrestricted, then prices cannot be much higher than production costs, no matter what the demand. &gt;Houston\n\n\"The city of Houston has the second-fewest homes available for the lowest income renters\"\n\nAnd this is your example of housing done by free market. Kudos for sinking your own ideas. I live in a town that has fewer restrictions. Nothing is stopping from building low income housing. NO ONE IS BUILDING LOW INCOME HOUSING. They build single family and higher income apartment building close to the seafront. Where i live used to have old dilapidated buildings. My landlord bought everything around me, tore it down and built the whole hill full of apartments... for higher income and every single low income apartment is now pretty much out of touch from the people who SHOULD have it: students since this is in the middle of a fucking campus. Instead of old cars and bikes we have Porches and Mercs in the parking lots. Because the difference between low income and higher income housing is MARGINAL when it comes to construction. But the profit is much higher. And they did it by buying an old mattress factory, renovated to low income housing mainly for students... who get benefits. Their entire fortune is built on government benefits, tax payers money.\n\nWhy would free market build stuff for the poor, they don't have money. It is FAR more profitable to build more expensive stuff and sell/rent it at a higher prices.\n\nFree market WILL NOT solve our problems, they do not have any incentives to do so.",

Well, everyone said that playing solo is possible, so what I'm here to say is that I pretty much can't remember what was the last time I felt comfortable talking in any game other than zenith.\n\nI always insta mute myself and others, but a freaking  kid came to me when I just spawned in the game for the first time and asked if I were a sword or magic user, very awkward response from my shitty English speaking skills and somehow, that ignited something inside of me to talk to people on zenith all the time.\n\nStill awkward sometimes, but I mostly just laugh at those moments, also I just interact a bit with people that have they mic muted and normally they start to feel comfortable and  just unmute to talk back.\n I'm really out of my comfort zone on zenith and I love it.\n\nSo to answer your question, yeah, an introvert definitely should play zenith, like I did.",

While the people who dont have jobs and are scamming the system pay little to nothing and supposedly my rates are higher to cover those people. Fucking joke!!!!

There are examples where this is, not ideal (for example, civil rights) but I've been thinking about whether this would be good for universal healthcare.\n\nRegardless if you support expanding the public option, or passing something like Medicare For All, a Republican majority in Congress or another Republican president would be horrible for our plans. Lets say, its 2022, and the Democrats expand Obamacare, or pass a single-payer plan like Medicare For All. What would happen if the Republican Party wins a congressional majority or a presidency? At the least, i think we could expect major cuts to funding for this system. And at most, it is completely repealed and replaced with something far worse.\n\nSo, should we pass universal healthcare (and other expansions to the social safety net) at the state-level? Some of these states have massive support for these ideas, so it is unlikely that they would get repealed. Additionally, a state with a program like this could be compared with a state that does not, which could boost popularity for universal healthcare.\n\nI will admit, I know almost nothing about states' ability to even do this, and whether they have the infrastructure to be able to, which is why I made this post, as I hope there are people who do know the answer to those questions. So, comment on this post if you have an opinion on this matter. Should we do this?

Why are you blaming medicaid for the failings of the hospital?\n\nIf you have medicaid, you are paying no premiums, and minimum cost sharing depending on how you qualified, so I am also unsure what you mean by you pay so much in premiums, deductible, etc. Those aren\u2019t a big issue for medicaid recipients. \n\nIf you plan to move to Texas, an unexpanded medicaid state, you won\u2019t be eligible for medicaid if your income is below 100% FPL and you won\u2019t qualify for federal help. You can move there if you are financially stable I guess. It\u2019s just doesn\u2019t have a strong social safety net. Arizona is fine since it has expanded medicaid. If I had to choose I would go to Arizona.\n\nThe location of the hospital don\u2019t matter for most non regional hmo marketplace plans. If you have a ppo that has a large multistate network, it\u2019s possible and normal to have out of state coverage that is in-network. This is especially true for geographically smaller states like Delaware, RI, etc. The key is to confirm network status with your insurance prior to visit if possible. The only state only plan is Medicaid since that is state specific, but it looks like you aren\u2019t on that.\n\nIf you have no proof of income they may rescind your advanced tax credits. If you end up hitting your projected income, by the end of the year they\u2019ll give it back to you when you file your taxes. It\u2019s a pretty fair system in that you will get your tax credits as long as you are meant to get them. If you can\u2019t show proof early on, you will eventually get them at tax time. You just can\u2019t get it in advanced like most people who don\u2019t have a big gap in income projection. Think of an accurate income projection as the ability to get an advance on tax credits. I see, so if I had to pay let\u2019s say $350/month on an ACA plan off the marketplace, and I stayed $1000 below the income I chose to pick up the plan, I would get a big discount for 12 months worth of PTC back into my pockets when I file the following year huh? Unless of course if I chose to just give them the income for that month I can just get the PTC right then and there for that month right? \n\nAlso if it comes to giving them proof of income month after month\u2026will that go on forever? Or would I have proven that I needed the PTC in advance rather than having to show proof month after month?",

This is what happens when the employees have different goals than the administration/owners/shareholders.

It would also allow for more choice.

It feels good and enlightening all be it extreme compared to a lot of world views. Adam tests many different books against each other and shows why he believes what he has learned to be true.

Early on in our relationship, we realized that I was the financially responsible one and she had difficulty budgeting/saving so when things got serious, we combined expenses and she has given me full trust/faith to manage all finances.\n\nI've always been the main breadwinner and making 100-130K/year the past few years. I don't think I'll go higher than this other than inflation salary increases. She was doing her medical school, residency and sub-spec training so she was getting paid minimal amounts. She'll be done with all training next year and she's looking at working in rural canada where she expects to make 500-600K/year. This is a major change from the 80K/year or so she was making to date. I work remotely so I can work from wherever so that's not an issue.\n\nThrough managing our finances, we have managed to pay off all our student debt, max our TFSAs and RRSPs to date.\n\nToday we were looking at houses for the first time and when looking at what we would qualify for I kept using her resident salary and saying we can't afford things. When she corrected me with her actual salary coming up though, I guess that's when reality hit. \n\nUp until now, I think I had no issue with managing both of our finances because I knew I was the breadwinner, helped pay down her student loans with my money too and so on. \n\nBut now, I guess I feel guilt and weird because I don't want to be micromanaging HER money. Up until now, it wasn't much of an issue because I felt like we were primarily living off my money anyways and her money was just being used to pay down her student loans and save. Now the situation will be different. I'm a male and she's a female so I wonder if gender stereotype roles play a role in my thought process too.\n\nso my question is: How do I manage a major change in my partner's salary?\n\nI am looking for advice from people who went through something similar and what you did for money management or even emotion management when this happened. Financially or from an ego perspective? Two different things with the same solution: One - you get a professional or learn to do it together.

            "text": "Politics in America is so often dominated by fear of the other and a resignation to electing the lesser of the two evils every time we vote. People talk about wanting a third party, but everybody knows how fundamentally difficult it is to establish one. Without the right kind of leadership that can build a coalition and thus political power a third party will waste away in obscurity, much like the Libertarian party and the Green party. \n\nI believe that Yang is someone who understands how the system functions and will pursue the right goals in establishing a new party. You have to work to win Congressional elections, state-level elections and even local. Only after you have established this base coalition and have tangible power in Washington can you begin to think about devoting critical resources towards a presidential election. \n\nThe need is on both sides, and Yang is someone who traditionally appeals to left-wing AND right-wing voters. He won't try to form a woke progressive party or a conspiratorial conservative party, but he will try to form a genuinely libertarian, big-tent party. Libertarianism is a concept that has not been meaningfully applied in the 21st century as democrats and republicans have both come to embrace big government, but people like Yang and Tulsi Gabbard give me a lot of hope for that approach. \n\nI made a [video on how much Yang fundamentally changed the discussion in America](https://youtu.be/esxInRGI6cw), and I fully believe that he is the right person to get this right and establish a functional, ideologically-diverse and populist party. Who knows if it will join the game as a third player or eventually drive the downfall of one of the major parties. \n\nA functional and modern third party that succeeds in establishing some degree of political power causes a paradigm shift in political thinking. The two major parties must contend with the fact that their power is more finite than the impression they currently have. The American people will have said loudly and clearly that we are dissatisfied and want vast changes to our nation. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many hating on this idea and believing that Yang is following a fruitless path. Let's debate, I really think he could be the person to shake up power structures and get America on the move again. I agree wholeheartedly on the libertarian bit. I think we need a new way of looking at the concept. To me it isn't \"every man for themselves\", but \"every man [and woman, etc] deserves the opportunity to live their best life\"",

Ones that will far outclass Hubble, being cheaper and higher tech. We could even send up several and combine their data to get far more resolution than one telescope on its own. I think the main advantage of Starship is that the payload mass can be huge while the costs are a fraction of current launch costs (if everything goes according to plan). So you don\u2018t need exotic, lightweight and expensive materials that are difficult to handle, but you can build your space telescope (or every satellite) sturdy and with huge safety margins. If it is easier to build, it becomes cheaper and you can build multiple ones based on the same design. So hopefully, one day we will have a whole class of space telescopes where every one outclasses Hubble.",

The more I frequent some of the climate change sub Reddit\u2019s or r/collapse, I can\u2019t help but think that in the next 50 years or less we are going to see the complete destruction of the way society is structured, and witness first hand, a mass extinction event of not only millions of species on this planet, but the human race as well.\n\nI think the people that frequent this sub are either curious or convinced as to who or what are piloting these crafts. And also speculate as to what their intentions might be. \n\nTo me, when I ask myself \u201cLet\u2019s just say for the sake of argument it\u2019s 100% an alien race of some kind, who are thousands, if not millions of years ahead of us technologically\u2026what are they doing here?\u201d\n\nFrom what I can gather is that, for the most part, they just seem to be observing us\u2026but why?\n\nAnd then I thought about the climate change issue and how it might relate to the observations of the UAP. And I think I\u2019m leaning that they might just be here to witness our demise\u2026and that\u2019s about it.\n\nI think maybe a lot can be learned about a species and a planet when it collapses. We might be a dime a dozen as far being a semi advanced species. But maybe what might be unique about us is our greed, religiosity, and are lack of self preservation in the face of certain extinction. Does anyone else think the two topics are related? I think aliens are real, and we should consider it very probable that if aliens are here, they could have developed BILLIONS of years ahead of us. Who would be likely to get here? Those who developed space travel first, and the Milky Way is nearly as old as the universe.  \n  \nI think we are like an experiment to the aliens, like a petri dish. I\u2019m not sure how far they would go to intervene, but I think they\u2019d prefer not to lose their investment in biological research. If we pollute the world enough, we won\u2019t be able to reproduce or survive.

Here is the link: [Book Giveaway #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WingifyBookClub/comments/pmqn85/book_giveaway_3_winners_announced_for_2/)\n\nWe had 11 submissions this time.  First of all, I struggled with this one (again). I had to read everything, and give marks based on the ideas and the quality of writing. I think its very hard to be objective with ideas as I might agree/disagree with them but its easy to be objective about the quality of writing. Anyway I went through everything multiple times and finally I decided on a winner! It is u/pi_yan_ka\n\nI will message you to get your address/contact details, and you will receive the book asap.\n\nAnyway, lets go to Book Giveaway #4.\n\nWe ran a [Poll](https://twitter.com/nifal_adam/status/1436974806742683648?s=20) to find the book of this week and it will be - **Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari**  \nSapiens tells the history of Homo Sapiens from a completely fresh perspective. It explains that money is the most pluralistic system of mutual trust ever devised; that capitalism is the most successful religion ever invented; that the treatment of animals in modern agriculture is probably the worst crime in history; and that even though we are far more powerful than our ancient ancestors, we aren\u2019t much happier. Its an intense, thought-provoking book.\n\nTo win you have to answer the following question here in Reddit itself. We wont use Twitter for answers anymore. \n\n**Question**: I have been thinking about starting a new business with a goal to bring massive awareness to the Climate Change problem that we all face. So I was thinking about creating a nice \"Brand Mascot\". Our Brand Mascot will be a \"**Friendly dinosaur that warns people about climate change\"**. Now we want to give a name to this brand mascot, can you suggest a name? The only condition is that the \".com\" domain name should also be available for under Rs 1000 (You can check the price easily in namecheap.com). If we like the domain name we will buy it as well :)\n\n(Note: A brand mascot is the materialization of a brand's personality in the form of an animal or animated object figure, symbolic in nature, that stands as its spokesperson and representative)\n\nI thought this will be an interesting question because I have been thinking about this for a few days, I would appreciate some help haha. This is part of a crypto startup in the advertising space, I am writing the whitepaper and will hopefully have an MVP for private sale in 2 months.\n\n\\--------------- Footnotes ---------------  \n**1)** Bookgiveaway #2 book is received by the winners!

            "text": "We aren\u2019t all far-right wingers and fascists. In fact, the fascists constitute a rather small layer within the military. However, I suspect they do have a disproportionate influence and impact relative to their numbers, because of higher-ranking people who are more likely to espouse this kind of ideology. I\u2019ve worked with Mormons and other fundamentalists who believed that they were literally fighting a holy war against Islam. These people are seen by the rank-and-file as silly and weird. \n\nWe are not cops. In addition, like the above, only a small layer of the military aspires to become cops. I knew one guy who wanted to be a cop when he got out, and nobody really liked him. He was a crybaby as well. \n\nThe US military is huge, and is more a cross-section of society than anything else, except for the lower classes which are overrepresented. Recruitment surges during recessions. Capital\u2019s reserve army of labor then desperately attempts to join the military in search of jobs, training, and healthcare for their families, in the absence of any other national jobs or job training program or national health care service. I joined in 2009 during a surge in recruitment due to the financial crash. I met people who had been laid off from their jobs, had spent months looking for something else, and then joined the military as their last resort. I met debt peons with worthless degrees who needed a way to pay back their loans (jokes about \u201cdegrees in basket weaving\u201d were common among drill sergeants, so I assume this has been happening for a long time). I had an NCO who had three felonies, and I never would have guessed he\u2019d been a three-time felon until he told me, who joined because he was desperate to turn his life around and needed to support his child. The same NCO even married a woman just to help her severely disabled child get healthcare through Tricare, since she was too poor and lived in a red-state with no healthcare assistance (this was also before some aspects of Obamacare went into effect). \n\nThe vast majority of veterans are not killers, even those who deployed overseas. The vast majority do not have PTSD as well. That is a harmful stereotype that needs to go. While my job was in the motor pool, most of the work I did involved landscaping, picking up trash, a lot of cleaning, a lot of paperwork, a lot of menial jobs which my fellow soldiers called \u201cbitch work,\u201d and occasionally pulling security or gate guard (standing around doing nothing/staring off into space for hours and checking IDs). The killing is mostly done by elite units and private contracted mercenaries. It\u2019s civilians that fire the drones now too. Military drone operators just watch/do reconnaissance but they can\u2019t shoot them. \n\nYes, sexual assault is an issue, but this is again perpetrated by a small layer. Sexual abuse in the military is just as \u201csystemic\u201d as it is in the rest of society. I was sexually assaulted multiple times and one of them I know with 99% certainty was a serial rapist. I was sexually assaulted as a teen as well, and can imagine what happened to me happening anywhere else, whether I ended up in college or some other workplace. I really don\u2019t think the problem of sexual abuse is any better or worse than anywhere else in society. The reason why there is so much discussion of sexual abuse in the military is because of major scandals in the past, and it used to be covered up a lot more. Also for the same reason shitty VA hospitals get exposed in the media but shitty private hospitals don\u2019t. The public sector is still held to a higher standard than the private sector. \n\nBefore you flame me, consider this: Why is that a there is higher proportion of black women than white women in the military compared to the civilian population? Could it be because black women have less access to other good opportunities than white women? Why are working class people overrepresented among enlisted? (there\u2019s been tons of propaganda about the military actually being from mostly middle-class background, but if you look deeper at how and what they determine what counts as middle-class, it can be questionable. Still, a higher percentage of people from the bottom quintile of income join than the top quintile. Go figure.)\n\nSo whenever I see a self-described \u201cleftist\u201d bashing veterans or some way or another, I can\u2019t help but think, who are these people? Wealthy upper-class ultra-leftists trying to impose their self-indulgent, petite-bourgeois morality on everyone else? Who the fuck are these people? Do they understand how incoherent their worldview is and how this only alienates the working class? Like, I can\u2019t figure out if they\u2019re part of some sort of op or if they are really just rich and dumb, completely cut off from the bulk of the population. What good does attacking a lowly E-1 do? I see so much uniformed takes and opinions on veterans in left media, and it makes the left look bad and out of touch. What good is a left for upper-middle class intellectuals only?\n\nI came from a bad, abusive home. I had no friends. There was nothing for me in my small rural town but drugs and sketchy dudes trying to hit me up on myspace. I was not welcome to stay at home past 18. I did the math and there was no way I could have worked a minimum wage job in my area and afford an apartment, utilities, and food. But it's not like I could have even secured a job in the first place either. I only got hired as a charity case in high school because of my learning disability. The military was the safest, most secure, most viable option for someone in my position. After all, another working class kid from my high school who also had a learning disability was able to join. \n\nI remember when I recited the oath, at the swearing in ceremony at in-processing, and I just mindlessly repeated the words because I didn\u2019t really understand what it meant. What is the \u201cAmerican way of life\u201d that I\u2019m swearing to protect? I still don\u2019t know! At the time I imagined it to be protecting the lifestyle of all those people in the cities and far-off places of the country and it meant the lifestyle of those rich people who lived in those huge suburban mccmansions that I saw on TV, so far away. \n\nI joined out of desperation, and honestly, I\u2019m not sorry nor do I feel I should be. I didn\u2019t belong but still there were so many like me, with a similar background and in a similar position as me. You have to keep in mind how huge the US military is, and the fact that we have no jobs programs outside the military to speak of, and very little social welfare. The military IS the country\u2019s main welfare program outside of SS. You have to recognize that, otherwise you\u2019re just victim-blaming. I met a socialist in community college who told me that his time in the military taught him that the US system is basically socialism (i.e. the military) protecting capitalism. That capitalism loves socialism, can't live without it, and employs it to protect the bedrock of capitalism, private property.",

Pokemon has more creatures to collect and train, has a much better artstyle and storyline as well as more interesting diversity.\nThere are more skills and a better, competitive aspect.
